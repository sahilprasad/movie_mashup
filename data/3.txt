               snowing.]
 
               [Kyle's house, night, bathroom. The toilet is seen and on it 
               are a glass and a plate of chocolate-chip cookies. Kyle sits 
               in his pajamas underneath a window and next to a night stand 
               and candle opposite the toilet bowl, and holding a small flag 
               which reads,
 
               WELCOME

               MR. HANKEY

                         to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Come sit by

                         you come on up to bed.

                         Just let us stay up a little longer, 
                         mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He 
                         always does.

               [The ant scurries away. At length, the candle burns down to the 
               plate and goes out. Kyle and Ike are both asleep. Sheila and 
               Gerald look in once again and find the boys asleep. Sheila picks 
               up Ike and Gerald picks up Kyle and take them to their respective 
               rooms. Kyle is then seen asleep in his room. He opens and blinks 
               his eyes, then gasps and sits up. He rushes out of bed and into 
               the restroom, only to find an empty plate and glass. He thinks 
               Mr. Hankey has been by, until he notices something on the floor 
               to the left of the toilet. A look of dismay comes over his face. 
               It's the ant he sees, now bloated and content. Kyle goes to make 
               a phone call.]

                         thing anymore, you know? So what's to 
                         celebrate?

                         Why? We're just pieces of crap. Christmas 
                         isn't for us.

                         Christmas is about feeling good. That's 
                         for everybody!
 
                                     CORNWALLIS
                         I see the Nativity. There's angels, 
                         shepherds and sheep. But no poo. All 
                         the Christmas movies: Santa, elves, 
                         reindeer. No poo. I'm not a part of 
                         it.
 
                                     MR. HANKEY
                         No, you're not a part of it, Carnwallis. 
                         You're all of it. Don't you see?
 
                                     CORNWALLIS
                         I'm nothing but crap!

                                     MR. HANKEY
                         But crap is everything. 

               Everything that lives on earth poos in some way

               And that's how the cycle happens, each and every day

               [Takes Cornwallis out and up to the street]

               Just look at the green green grass and the birds up in the sky
 
               
               [cows graze on the some exposed grass while large birds fly lazily 
               above]
 
               It's all here because of poo, and now I'll tell you why

               'Cause it's eaten by cattle, which is eaten by women and men
 
               
               [A cow poops as it eats, then Butters' family is shown eatng 
               burgers at table]
 
               It fuses with their bodies and becomes poo again

               [Mr. Jankey sings to Cornwallis, then Butters' father is shown 
               straining on the toilet]
 
               And that poo goes through the sewer, where it's dumped into the 
               sea.
 
               [some poo descends through the pipe, and Mr. Hankey soon follows. 
               A raw sewage outlet is then shown with Mr. Hankey exiting]
 
               
               And it's eaten by the plankton, and becomes the fishes' meal.
 
               
               [plankton swarm the poo and devour it; a small fish eats the 
               plankton]
 
               And then that bigger fish with the poo still inside

               [a bigger fish eats the small fish, but an even bigger one approaches]
 
               
               Swims up near the shore and gets eaten alive

               [the bigger fish swallows the medium-sized one and swims up to 
               the surface, only to be snatched up by a bear]
 
               By the grizzly bear that poos on a dead piece of sand

               [the bear walks off with the fish in its mouth and poos as he 
               leaves]
 
               So it can spring to life and become food for the land

               [flowers and grass spring up through and around it. The camera 
               pulls back to reveal an African savvannah around the flowers, 
               with all sorts of animals in it]
 
               It's the poo of the antelope, the poo of the giraffe

               [soft backup vocals come on, lending the song an African feel. 
               antelope run in the background as a giraffe appears and stops]
 
               
               It falls onto the earth and becomes the blades of grass

               [The camera looks at Mr. Hankey and Cornwallis atop Poo Rock, 
               first from the back, then from the front]
 
               The grass is eaten by the cattle, which comes out the other end
 
               
               [more cattle are shown grazing and pooing]

               To make food for the humans and start all over again

               [a man scoops the poo into a small bag and walks off; Butters 
               and family eat more burgers; his mom sits on the toilet]
 
               
               [back on Poo Rock, before which animals poo freely] You see, 
               son? You're not an insignificant part of life. You are life. 
               
 
                                     CORNWALLIS
                         But how can I be that giraffe and blade 
                         of grass, and a human? I don't control 
                         what they do.
 
                                     MR. HANKEY
                          Just like your heart beats without 
                         you thinking about it, so, too, your 
                         giraffes and your humans do what they 
                         do without you even thinkin' about it. 
                         But it is all one life form. It is all... 
                          you.

                          I think I see now.

               I'm the poo of the antelope, that flows down to the ground

               [steps forward]

                                     MR. HANKEY
                         Becomes the grass of tomorrow

                         Which the grazers turn around

               [An antelope stops to poo a little, then runs off to join the 
               others]

                         So I'm the leg of a leopard and the

                         Aw, hell, we all did it!

                         Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How 
                         would you like to have your own show 
                         and make 100 more of them?

                         Are you kidding? I think we'd rather 
                         stab ourselves in the head.

                         presents.

                          Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents 
                         for eight days.
