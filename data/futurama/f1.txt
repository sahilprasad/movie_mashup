                         Of course, since the greenhouse gases 
                         are still building up, it takes more 
                         and more ice each time.  Thus solving

                                     BENDER
                         We pollute too much. We're destroying 
                         the world and killing the turtles.
 
                         
               
                                     PREACHERBOT
                         To hell with the turtles!

               
                                     BENDER
                         No one insults the turtles!

               
               [He punches Preacherbot.]

               
                                     PREACHERBOT
                         Oh mercy.

               
               [He pulls out a knife and he and Bender fight.]

               
                                     HEDONISMBOT
                         Let the games begin!

               
               [It chuckles. The Planet Express ship flies in and lands. Fry 
               and Leela carry the Professor out and stand him in front of the 
               microphone on the stage.]
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Everyone listen!

               
               [The robots stop fighting. Bender punches Preacherbot again. 
               He falls over.]
 
               
                                     PREACHERBOT
                         Aw damn!

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         I've devised a way to save you and to 
                         stop global warming at the same time! 
                         Granted you're all blasting out greenhouse 
                         gases.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         You're one to talk!

               
               [Preacherbot hits him with a chair. He falls over onto his back. 
               He tries to get up but can't.]
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         But we can use those very gases to save 
                         the planet. If you all vent your exhaust 
                         directly upward in one burst it should 
                         thrust the Earth further from the sun, 
                         thus cooling it.  By my calculations 
                         we'll need the full force of every last 
                         robot. So quickly, everyone point your 
                         exhaust vents straight upwards.  Now 
                         vent! Vent like the wind!  Harder! Harder!
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         Why isn't this working?!

               
                                     LEELA
                         Some lazy or polite robot is holding 
                         it in.
 
               
               [Bender is still on his back, unable to vent.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         Help! Help!!

               
               [Cut to: Nixon's Helicopter. Wernstrom is turning the mirror 
               towards the robots.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Galapogas Islands. The robots continue to vent but to 
               no avail.]
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         A billion robot lives are about to be 
                         extinguished! Oh the Jedi's are going 
                         to feel this one!
 
               
               [Bender and the turtle are still on their backs.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         I'm sorry buddy. At least we'll die 
                         on our backs, helpless.  Huh? What the 
                         hell are you doing?  Hey are you trying 
                         to make me look bad?  Ah ha! I'm even 
                         greater than I thought I was! And now 
                         to fullfill my destiny.
 
               
               [He stands on his hands and vents. The flame grows bigger and 
               the Earth moves.]
 
               
               [Nixon's Helicopter.]

               
                                     NIXON
                         Fire!!  What the??

               
                                     WERNSTROM
                         We missed.

               
               [Agnoo growls.]

               
               [Galapogas Islands. The skies have cleared and the crew are standing 
               on the stage. Nixon is with them.]
 
               
                                     NIXON
                         Professor, for saving the Earth and 
                         foiling me, I proudly, yet angrily, 
                         present you with Earth's new highest 
                         honour: The Polluting Medal Of Pollution.
 
                         
               
               [He hangs the medal around Farnsworth. The industrial chimneys 
               on the medal blow smoke in Farnsworth's face making him cough.]
 
               
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Thank you. I deserve this!

               
               [The robots cheer.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         Hey Professor! Now that the Earth's 
                         orbit is further from the sun won't 
                         that make the year longer?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Why yes! One week longer to be exact.
 
                         
               
                                     NIXON
                         In that case I hereby declare it Robot 
                         Party Week!
 
               
               [The robots cheer and dance to Buster Poindexter and his Banshees 
               Of Blue's Hot Hot Hot. Then they vent.]
