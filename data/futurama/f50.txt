                         People, we got a problem: Little Nibbler's 
                         been coughing up hairballs.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Well, so has Fry. What's the big deal?
 
                         
               
               [Nibbler coughs up a huge one. In amongst the green gloop is 
               a white cane. Fry makes an impressed whistle.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         He's got me beat!

               
                                     HERMES
                         Now well all love Nibbler, so it's only 
                         fair that we all pitch in and clean 
                         it up together. Still, I propose we 
                         make Zoidberg do it. All in favour?
 
                         
               
               [Everyone except Zoidberg raises their hands.]

                         Yeah!

               
                                     BENDER
                         Alright, yup.

               [Again no one votes. Leela taps Zoidberg on the shoulder.]

               [He keels over and rests on Fry's shoulder. Fry looks at him.]

                         He always seemed so full of life. Laughing, 
                         singing, begging for scraps. And now 
                         this.
 
               
               [He takes off his glasses and cries. The door opens and Zoidberg 
               walks in wearing a towel. But his body is white-pink and is wobbling 
               around like lobster jelly.]

                         Why with all the crying?  So that's 
                         where I left my shell.
 
               
               [He wobbles over to the table. Leela picks up the shell.]

                         It was starting to get a little cramped 
                         in there so I molted, why not? Ah, the 
                         fresh air feels good!

                         So long. I'm off to toss this old shell 
                         in the dumpster and maybe pick up those 
                         potato chips Amy didn't finish yesterday.

               back of it. As he walks out his towel falls off. The sound of

                         again?

                         up 10 times a day for a year.

                         I just wish a decent guy would call 
                         me instead of this spleeze-ball who 
                         has me too terrified to even answer 
                         the phone.  Hello?

                         I'm sorry. You're crying like a woman. 
                          It's alright. I've always thought myself 
                         as a father figure to some of my more 
                         pathetic men. Kif, old friend, let's

                         Intruder! Stay away from the mighty 
                         Femputer! Guards!
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Time to override the CPU and reprogram 
                         this Femputer.
 
               
               [He takes out a pipe and starts hitting the Femputer.]

               
                                     FEMPUTER
                         Hey, whoa, whoa! Stop it! Stop it! Hey, 
                         cut that out!
 
               
               [A panel falls down revealing a hollow section of the Femputer 
               with a bed, a curtain and lots of levers. Also a Fembot.]
 
               
                                     FEMBOT
                         Cease hitting Femputer!

               
               [She turns around and sees Bender and screams.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         You're no Femputer, you're a Fembot!
 
                         
               
                                     FEMBOT
                         (ashamed) It's true. I disguised myself 
                         as a Femputer so I could rule the Amazonians.
 
                         
               
                                     BENDER
                         But why?

               
                                     FEMBOT
                         Why? Why? I came here from a faraway 
                         planet. A planet ruled by a chauvinistic 
                         Manputer that was really a Manbot. Have 
                         you any idea how it feels to be a Fembot 
                         living in a Manbot's Manputer's world?
 
                         
               
                                     BENDER
                         What?

               
                                     FEMBOT
                         And now, my meddling Manbot, there's 
                         the question of what to do with you!
 
                         
               
               [She narrows her eyes and moves towards him. He backs away, waving 
               his arms and panicking.]
 
               
               [Snu-Snu Chambers. The Amazonians are queued up waiting for their 
               snu-snu. Fry and Zapp walk out, gasping.]
 
               
                                     ZAPP
                         (gasping) We need rest. The spirit is 
                         willing but the flesh is spongy and 
                         bruised.
 
               
                                     ORNIK
                         It time snu-snu!

               
                                     FRY
                         Can't we just cuddle?  (screaming) Nooo!
 
                         
               
               [She carries him inside. Kug picks up Zapp. He groans and she 
               takes him in.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         We can't wait for Bender. It's time 
                         for a woman's touch.  Yah! Hi-yah! Yah, 
                         yah yah!
 
               
               [An Amazonian picks her up by her ponytail, throws her on the 
               floor and sits on her. Amy walks past on stilts. She has put 
               a bone through her hair and torn her dress.]

                         (disguised, deeper voice) Me next snu-snu. 
                         Out me way.

               [She pokes him with a broom and he runs around the ceiling, his 
               hands and feet sticking to it. Amy walks in. She sees Kif and 
               Thog and gasps. She jumps off the stilts and holds out her arms.]

               [Outside Femputer Temple. Amy runs past the steps still carrying 
               Kif with the Amazonians chasing her.]

               [They chase her around the side of the temple. Ornik, Kug and 
               another group of Amazonians block her path. She gasps and ducks 
               through a crack in the wall.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Femputer Temple. Amy runs towards the Femputer and the 
               Amazonians run in and corner her. Thog gets on her knees in front 
               of the Femputer.]

                         Ooh! I'm a scary Femputer. Release the 
                         prisoners!  (from inside) And bring 
                         gold. Lots of gold.

                         And that's how I got my new shell. It 
                         looks just like the shell I threw out 
                         yesterday and I found it in the same 
                         dumpster, but this one had a live raccoon 
                         inside.  Pretty good story, eh, Hermes?

                         It's funny how the battle of the sexes 
                         was only resolved when a Manbot and 
                         a Fembot realised they loved each other.

                         not here. All I know is this gold says 
                         that was the best mission ever!
 
               
               [He closes his door. Inside and on the table are big bars of 
               gold. On the couch Kif yawns and puts his arm around Amy. She 
               giggles.]
