                         Wait, stop! We give in to all of Earth's 
                         demands. The war is over. Our home planet 
                         is yours.

                         All right! Hey. Wait a minute! This 
                         is your home planet? We're the evil, 
                         invading aliens?

                         Then I guess you learned a valuable 
                         lesson: Don't mess with Earth.

                         Hey, chumps and chumpettes. Did you 
                         get the bomb out? Can I go back to saying 
                         the word I love to say?

                         It's stuck in there with glue or something. 
                         I don't know.

                         the point of living if I can't say "ass"? 
                          Hey, I didn't blow up! Ass, ass, ass,

                         It's from the list of words you almost 
                         never say.
