                         Of course, since the greenhouse gases 
                         are still building up, it takes more

                         stop global warming at the same time! 
                         Granted you're all blasting out greenhouse

                         But we can use those very gases to save 
                         the planet. If you all vent your exhaust 
                         directly upward in one burst it should 
                         thrust the Earth further from the sun, 
                         thus cooling it.  By my calculations 
                         we'll need the full force of every last 
                         robot. So quickly, everyone point your 
                         exhaust vents straight upwards.  Now 
                         vent! Vent like the wind!  Harder! Harder!

               and brings it back into the vent. Fry groans from the heat.]

                         The person who gave up her whole evening 
                         to watch it. A whole evening of TV gone. 
                         What a mockery of justice it is that

                         But then again, I promised the coin

                         Wait a minute. If our universes are 
                         identical then why did our Leela look 
                         into the box and your Leela didn't?

                         Well to be honest I tossed a coin. It 
                         came up tails so I didn't look.

                         Interesting. Apparently the key difference 
                         between our universes is that coin flips 
                         have opposite outcomes.

                         Well then there's only one solution.

                         ...Have you ever tried simply turning 
                         off the TV, sitting down with your children, 
                         and hitting them?

                         Well, I'd say we all learned a valuable 
                         lesson about TV there.

                         Uh...that we should all take TV a little 
                         less seriously. And more importantly, 
                         turn it off once in a while.

                         made me smart? I could play the holophonor 
                         and it made Leela like me.  Hey Bender, 
                         as long as you know, I have a holophonor 
                         recital Tuesday and I'd really like

                         soul. Then one day I found someone else's 
                         couch fibres on his butt.

                         naked on her couch if I could just learn 
                         to play this stupid thing.

                         to metaphorically make a "deal with

                         Ah Fry, congratulations. Your latest 
                         performance was as delectable as dipping 
                         my bottom over and over into a bath 
                         of the silkiest oils and creams!
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Thank you sir, that's exactly what I 
                         was going for.
 
               
                                     HEDONISMBOT
                         You were the sole diversion in what 
                         has been a pale and unamusing season. 
                         And so I would feign commission you 
                         write an opera.

                         But, I've never written an opera.

                         And I've never heard one. Still, if 
                         you can keep me amused through the overture 
                         I shall consider it a smashing success.

                         But I wouldn't even know what to write 
                         about. Unless...  OK I'll do it. If 
                         I can make it about Leela.

                         shall see you at the premiere.

               the sound. She sees holographic silhouettes coming from underneath 
               a door like Bender did in the apartment.]

               notes on a music sheet.]

                         I-I don't want you to hear it 'til it's 
                         done.

                         'til it's cooked. This has to be perfect. 
                         I want you to hear exactly what I hear

                         incredible gift and I never knew. I've 
                         been a fool. A fully justified prudent 
                         fool.  They're so cold.

                         a boring dried up wasteland. And the 
                         only reason anybody ever comes here 
                         is for the tacky little amusement park. 
                         Can't you just accept that?
 
               
                                     FRY
                         I guess I can't.

               
               [They hear a shot from outside. They look through the transparent 
               barn doors and see Bender running out of the farmhouse.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Farmyard. The farmer chases him out of the house waving 
               his rifle.]
 
               
                                     FARMER
                         I'll learn ye to sleep with my robot 
                         daughters!
 
               
               [Bender runs into the barn.]

               
               [Cut to: Barn. He leans against the transparent door. Outside 
               the farmer reloads his gun.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         He'll never find me in here.

               
                                     LEELA
                         Bender?

               
                                     FRY
                         Oh, Bender. You didn't touch the Crushinator, 
                         did you?
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Of course not. A lady that fine you 
                         gotta romance first.
 
               
               [Another gunshot smashes the barn door behind Bender. Bender 
               legs it while the farmer reloads. Fry and Leela follow him through 
               another door. They pick up their helmets as they run.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Farmyard. They grab some oxygen tanks and get into the 
               moon buggy.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Lunar Surface. The buggy speeds away from the farm. 
               The farmer, in a spacesuit but with his cap sat on top, Lulabelle 
               7 and Daisy-Mae 128K run after them. The farmer fires a shot 
               at them and misses.]
 
               
                                     FARMER
                         Oh, no you don't! C'mere Crushinator.
 
                         
               
               [Crushinator drives out of the farm and pulls up beside him.]
 
               
               
                                     CRUSHINATOR
                         (mechanical voice) Yes, Pa.

               
               [She transforms into a car. The farmer and his other two daughters 
               get in and drive after Fry, Leela and Bender. They chase the 
               crew around past craters and through ravines. The farmer takes 
               a shot at the crew and narrowly misses them. The crew round a 
               corner and find their way blocked by a rock bridge.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         It's too low.

               
                                     LEELA
                         Hang on. Hang on. Jump.  Hold on to 
                         your helmet!
 
               
               [They jump the gorge, flying over crocodiles with space helmets 
               and land safely on the other side. They all cheer and then a 
               wheel falls off the buggy. The Crushintor approaches the other 
               side and stops. The farmer climbs out and slams the door.]
 
               
               
                                     FARMER
                         God darn, it Crushinator, jump!

               
                                     CRUSHINATOR
                         (mechanical voice) No, Pa. I love him.
 
                         
               
               [The farmer takes his hat off and jumps on it, groaning. Leela 
               looks at the broken wheel and Fry sees a huge shadow approaching.]
 
               
               
                                     FRY
                         Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!

               
               [Leela gasps.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         Nightfall's coming.  Hurry, before we 
                         freeze.
 
               
               [The flee from the shadow.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         What do you mean "we", mammal?

               
               [Cut to: Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. He watches the crew 
               through a telescope.]
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Oh, dear! I really ought to do something. 
                         But I am already in my pyjamas.
 
               
               [He falls asleep and starts snoring.]

               
               [Cut to: Lunar Surface. Fry and Leela are panting.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         We can't outrun it forever.

               
               [Fry sees something.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Over there! Look! It's the moon landing 
                         site! We found it!
 
               
               [They run towards it. Leela climbs the ladder and pushes over 
               the hatch.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Quick, get in.

               
               [Fry sees the American flag.]

               
                                     FRY
                         It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's 
                         footprint!  Hey! My foot's bigger! Leela, 
                         isn't this the greatest thing you've 
                         ever seen?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Fry, look around. It's just a crummy 
                         plastic flag and a dead man's tracks 
                         in the dust.  Now get in here before 
                         you freeze.
 
               
               [Fry sighs and climbs the ladder.]

               
               [Cut to: Apollo 11 Lander. Leela helps him in.]

               
               [Cut to: Lunar Surface. She closes the door just as Bender arrives.]
 
               
               
                                     BENDER
                         Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll 
                         go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack 
                         and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar 
                         lander and the blackjack. Ah, screw 
                         the whole thing.
 
               
               [He walks off.]

               
               [Apollo 11 Lander. Leela reads the oxygen gauge.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         Well if the oxygen holds out we might 
                         live long enough to starve to death.
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should 
                         have dragged you out here.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         That's right, you shouldn't have. I 
                         still don't get what the big attraction 
                         is.
 
               
               [Fry sighs.]

               
                                     FRY
                         I never told anybody this but a thousand 
                         years ago I used to look up at the moon 
                         and dream about being an astronaut. 
                         I just didn't have the grades. Nor the 
                         physical endurance. Plus I threw up 
                         a lot and nobody liked spending a week 
                         with me.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         A week would be a little much.

               
                                     FRY
                         The moon was like this awesome, romantic, 
                         mysterious thing, hanging up there in 
                         the sky where you could never reach 
                         it, no matter how much you wanted to. 
                         But you're right. Once you're actually 
                         here it's just a big dull rock. I guess 
                         I just wanted you to see it through 
                         my eyes, the way I used to.
 
               
               [Leela looks through a window. She sees the Earth.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         Fry, look. It really is beautiful. I 
                         don't know why I never noticed before.
 
                         
               
               [Bender runs towards the capsule.]

               thing with spikes.]

                         Had to come back for the Crushinator, 
                         eh, robot? Well I got you this time.
 
                         
               
               [The spikes get closer to Bender. The Planet Express ship swoops 
               in above them. The magnetic winch lowers towards Bender.]

                         he learns, he loves.

                         that. I must have been really acting

                         you'll be living which is great because,

                         and the one-eyed lady and the Chinese 
                         girl but everyone on this floor is having 
                         trouble with their TV reception.

                         causing it or we're outta this dump!

                         apartment that smelled like a sewer. 
                         You liked that one, right?

                         kinda settled in here.

                         Or we could live underground with the 
                         mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's 
                         boss!

                         we could do this with you going and 
                         me not going?

                         anyway. Won't you be just as happy back 
                         in your old place?

                         visit me here.

                         Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This 
                         way we'll both be happy.

                         a garbage can to put that dog in! Here

                         dog was fast-fossilised, preserving

                         to attempt to clone Fry's dog. Using 
                         the very same apparatus I used to clone 
                         you!  Ooo look, there's a smidge of

                         be a delivery boy next millenium!  What's 
                         with Seymour? Its like he don't want 
                         you to go. Or he thinks your pants is

                         Sorry, but we need to practice hand

                         can walk him. Of course, after he goes 
                         you have to refill the canisters. C'mere

                         May yet? Really?

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Indeed. You see, that fossil was made 
                         of dolomite. The tough black mineral 
                         that won't cop out when there's heat 
                         all about. By contrast, observe the 
                         lava's affect on this ice swan.  Of 
                         course, that would have melted even 
                         at room temperature. I just wanted to 
                         get rid of it. But had it been made 
                         of that righteous mineral dolomite, 
                         there's a slim chance it might have 
                         survived.

                         So Seymour might still exist?

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Perhaps. For a few minutes. It's dolomite 
                         baby!

                         15? You mean he lived for 12 more years

                         Think about it. Seymour lived a full 
                         life after I was gone. He probably added 
                         new songs to his repertoire.

                         when I knew him and that's when I loved 
                         him.  I'll never forget him. But he 
                         forgot me a long long time ago.

               then autumn, a snowy and rainy winter and back to spring. Panucci 
               gives Seymour a slice of pizza. It goes through autumn and winter 
               again. Seymour starts to age a little. The "U" from the "Panucci's 
               Pizza" sign falls on a man. An aged Panucci pats Seymour on the 
               head. Seymour continues waiting for Fry to return, and closes

                         the security cordon around Vergon 6. 
                         I'm anticipating an all-out tactical 
                         dogfight, followed by a light dinner...ravioli, 
                         ham, sundae bar.

                                     LEELA
                         Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship.
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?

               
                                     LEELA
                         Uh-huh!

               
                                     FRY
                         Who's the Zapp Brannigan?

               
               [Cut to: Nimbus Bridge. Zapp and Kif watch the ship approach.]
 
               
               
                                     KIF
                         Shall I fire on them now, sir?

               
                                     ZAPP
                         Not yet, Kif. In the game of chess, 
                         you can never let your adversary see 
                         your pieces.  What?
 
               
               [Cut to: Ships Cockpit.]

                         They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly 
                         saved the Octillian system from a horde 
                         of rampaging Killbots.

                         Wow!

               
                                     BENDER
                         A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we 
                         can always build more Killbots!
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         He's the most decorated captain in the 
                         whole Democratic Order Of Planets.

                                     LEELA
                         No I don't. But I think we ought to 
                         meet with him and see if he'll help 
                         us rescue those animals.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Well just in case you guys hit it off 
                         you'll wanna take this with you.
 
               
               [He holds up the fork.]

                                     KIF
                         Sir, they're headed straight for us.
 
                         
               
                                     ZAPP
                         A well-calculated move straight out 
                         of Sun Tzu's classic text The Art Of 
                         War, or my own masterwork: Zapp Brannigan's 
                         Big Book Of War.  But the one thing 
                         their captain doesn't realise and never 
                         will is that --
 
               
                                     KIF
                         Sir, they've docked with us and have 
                         come aboard.
 
               
                                     ZAPP
                         Then I have risked all and lost. Kif, 
                         old man, I'll be in the escape pod. 
                          If that wicker chair I like survives 
                         the slaughter, have it sent to my P.O. 
                         box.
 
               
               [The door opens and the Planet Express crew walk in. Zapp screams 
               and hides behind a chair. Leela looks around and sees Kif.]
 
               
               
                                     LEELA
                         Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet 
                         Express delivery ship. We've come aboard 
                         to plead for your assistance.
 
               
                                     KIF
                         Well, if there's anything --

               
               [Zapp jumps in front of Kif.]

                         I'm in command here. Zapp Brannigan. 
                         Has my fame preceded me or was I too 
                         quick for you?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Oh, not at all. I'm just so uh...really 
                         thrilled to meet you!
 
               
                                     ZAPP
                         You're an impressive piece of captain. 
                         Beautiful and deadly - a potent combination.
 
                         
               
                                     LEELA
                         (flattered) You don't mean that!

               
                                     ZAPP
                         But I do. I doubt I've seen more than 
                         three or four captains sexier than you, 
                         and only one who was deadlier.
 
               
               [He takes her hand and Fry leans in.]

                         I heard that one time you single-handedly 
                         defeated a horde of rampaging somethings 
                         in the something something system.
 
                         
               
                                     ZAPP
                         The Killbots? A trifle! It was simply 
                         a matter of outsmarting them.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Wow! I never would have thought of that!
 
                         
               
                                     ZAPP
                         You see, Killbots have a preset kill 
                         limit. Knowing their weakness, I sent 
                         wave after wave of my own men at them, 
                         until they reached their limit and shutdown. 
                         Kif, show them the medal I won.

                         going.
 
               
               [He carries on.]

                         talk to you about our mission.

                         Whatever it is, I'm willing to put wave 
                         after wave of men at your disposal. 
                         Right men?
 
               
               [He raises his glass to the crew.]

                         Vergon 6 from extinction. And if you 
                         could just --

                         The Democratic Order Of Planets prohibits 
                         interfering with undeveloped worlds.

                         Law".
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         But people already interfered. That 
                         planet was mined completely hollow.

                         mining crew.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         This doesn't make any sense.

                         Law. I merely enforce it.

                         if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw 
                         me in prison.

                         hit 70 blerns!

                         He's good, alright. But he's no Clem 
                         Johnson. And Johnson played back in 
                         the days before steroid injections were 
                         mandatory.

                         Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't 
                         have lasted one pitch in the old Robot 
                         Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there 
                         was a blern hitting machine!
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Exactly! He was a machine designed to 
                         hit blerns! I mean, come on, Wireless 
                         Joe was nothing but a programmable bat 
                         on wheels.

                         Oh, and I suppose Pitchomat 5000 was 
                         just a modified howitzer?
 
               
                                     LEELA

                         us on the field.

                         all kinds of robots down there.

                         Yeah, doing crap work! They're bat boys, 
                         ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But 
                         how many robot managers are there?

                                     BENDER
                         Zero!  And what a surprise! Look who's 
                         scraping up the filth. Is it a human 
                         child? I wish!

                         in. Everyone is to return to the office 
                         immediately.  Get away, you filthy bird! 
                         Shoo! Shoo! Professor, turn me off, 
                         quick!

                         Admit it: You all think robots are just 
                         machines built by humans to make their 
                         lives easier.

               a Planet Express label on it and "Chapek 9" written on it.]
 
               
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Great news, everyone. You'll be delivering 
                         a package to Chapek 9, a world where 
                         humans are killed on sight.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Why is that great news?

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         I'm glad you asked that question, Fry. 
                         You see, Chapek 9 was colonised centuries 
                         ago by a murderous crew of radical robot 
                         separatists.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Oh, so just 'cause a robot wants to 
                         kill humans that makes him a "radical"?
 
                         
               
                                     LEELA
                         Hey, hold on. I understand these robots 
                         hate humans, but how do they feel about 
                         humanoid aliens?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH

                         That's why Bender will have to make 
                         the actual delivery.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Oh, I get it, make the robot do all 
                         the work!

                         ever had to do around here.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot 
                         holiday.

                                     BENDER
                         Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks 
                         on the robot calendar.

                         Oh, come on, Bender. Last month it was 
                         Robomadom and before that Robonza.

                         It wasn't just a blast. It was a sacred 
                         tribute to my ancestral prototypes which 
                         happened to take the form of a drinking 
                         contest.

                         Now, look here, Bender. I respect your 
                         diversity to the extent the law requires 
                         but you used up all your days off when 
                         you had that bout with Roberculosis.
 
                         
               
                                     BENDER
                         Alright, I'll go. But so help me, I'll 
                         hold a grudge against every last stinking 
                         one of you for the rest of your lives.

                         So let me get this straight: This planet 
                         is completely uninhabited?
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         No. It's inhabited by robots!

               
                                     FRY
                         Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited 
                         by boxes.

                         OK, Bender, we're here. It's time to 
                         get to work.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Yes, Miss Leela. Tote that space barge, 
                         lift that space pale.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Now we can't land on the surface because 
                         those robots will kill Fry and me. So 
                         we'll have to stay up here and lower 
                         you with the winch. And remember: You 
                         don't know humans, you don't work for 
                         humans, and, above all, you don't like 
                         humans.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         (ironic) I'll try to keep that in mind!

                         too if I had to go to some uninhabited 
                         planet.

                         for him.

                         I felt terrible when I heard about your 
                         money troubles and I thought maybe I 
                         could help out a sweet young man by 
                         buying his anchovies.

                         control the robot oil business and I 
                         won't let you ruin me. How much do you 
                         want?

                         even more important. My friends. And

                         really do things right you gotta strangle 
                         yourself a fresh one.  Now this is why

                         first meal and he's a little sensitive. 
                         So let's be supportive, OK?

                         tasted. And I once a big heaping bowl

                         It's salt with water in it if that's 
                         what you mean.

                         There was nothing wrong with that food. 
                         The salt level was 10% less than a lethal 
                         dose.

                         things before you were born! I think 
                         I know what I'm doing.

                         So after I specifically asked you not 
                         to touch anything, you drank a bottle

                         just like the story of the grasshopper 
                         and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper 
                         kept burying acorns for winter while 
                         the octopus mooched off his girlfriend

                         came and the grasshopper died and the 
                         octopus ate all his acorns and also 
                         he got a racecar. Is any of this getting

                         We've gotta get the Emperor out of your 
                         body before they kill you!

                         Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in 
                         a high-speed centrifuge separating out 
                         the denser fluid of His Highness.

                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Oh, right, right, with the bones! I 
                         always forget about the bones.

                         dripped out through somebody's armpit.

                         I could vomit or urinate. Would you 
                         feel better about that?
 
               
                                     BONT
                         Slightly. But my favourite so far is 
                         the bone-crushing.

                         That's a great idea! Crying.

               
                                     BONT
                         Fine. That or the bone one.

                         too macho.

                         pimple on society's ass and you'll never 
                         amount to anything.

                         reminder: Everyone you knew or loved 
                         in the 20th century is dead.

                         OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 
                         'cause there's no God and your idiotic 
                         human ideals are laughable!

                         We should call Leela for help.

                         and wreck it by surviving.

                         We only got two drops.

               
               [There is a bang at the door. The Trisolians begin leaking in 
               through a hole. Bont chuckles.]

                         It's only a matter of time now.

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         I'll handle this!

               
               [He tries to block the leak with his claw and eventually gets 
               it under control by forcing one of his mouth flaps into the hole.]
 
               
               
                                     LEELA
                         Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out 
                         of this if you're willing to let me 
                         help you.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take 
                         all the help you're willing to give. 
                         I know you just want what's best for 
                         me.  Ow! What was that for?  Hey, come 
                         on!  That hurt!
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         I know. Amy, get the bottle.

               
               [She carries on beating Fry up while Amy holds the bottle under 
               his eye.]

                         Come on. Everybody help out Fry.

               
               [She slaps him again, Zoidberg pinches his leg with his claw 
               and Bender stubs out a cigar on his arm.]

                         all. You guys are true -- ow! Cut it 
                         out, Bender! That's a tender area!

                         Great! We're one-tenth of the way there.
 
                         
               
               [Time Lapse. Leela, Zoidberg and Bender are tired out. Amy keeps 
               kicking the Emperor out of Fry. She pants.]
 
               
                                     AMY
                         OK, it's your turn.

               
               [She points to someone. A Trisolian starts to hit Fry with a 
               chair.]
 
               
                                     FRY

                         I'm the Emperor! Thanks for crying me 
                         out.

                         Oh, you're welcome.

               cries in pain from inside.]

                         be making a delivery to Ebola 9, the

                         I want all of you to be alive. It's 
                         the Academy of Inventors annual symposium.

                         It's the event of the scientific season. 
                         Every member presents an invention and 
                         the best one wins the Academy prize.

                         Sounds boring.

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Oh, my, yes. But not this year, because 
                         my latest invention is unbeatable. Behold! 
                         The death clock.  Simply jam your finger 
                         in the hole and this readout tells you 
                         exactly how long you have left to live.

                         Well it's occasionally off by a few 
                         seconds. What with free will and all.

                         left to live?

                         Why don't you just leave me alone, Wernstrom?!

                         hill. It's time to leave science to 
                         the 120-year-olds.
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         You young turks think you know everything. 
                         I was inventing things when you were 
                         barely turning senile.

                         going to take a nap before the ceremonies.

                         student at Mars University. But then 
                         after one fateful pop-quiz...

                         later and still no revenge. I'm essentially

                         the spray-on toupee and - of course 
                         - the technology to keep human heads 
                         alive in jars.  But wait, there's more. 
                         We've got a whole line-up of inventors 
                         tonight, starting with that up and coming 
                         young star, Ogden Wernstrom.

                         evening, grandpa?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Let's just say it'll put you young whippersnappers 
                         in your place!

                         I just hope it's not as lame as that 
                         death clock you presented last year.

                         That's right.

                         Oh, my! Did it put you young whippersnappers 
                         in your place?
 
               
                                     WERNSTROM
                         Hardly! We laughed until our teeth fell 
                         out. Come along, Cinnamon.

                         Oh, dear, I'll have to invent something 
                         new in the next ten minutes. Perhaps 
                         some sort of death clock.

                         Our last presentation comes from our 
                         oldest member, Professor Hubert Farnsworth. 
                         Professor?
 
               
               [A spotlight falls on Farnsworth. He is scribbling something 
               on a piece of paper.]

               [Farnsworth snarls and runs onto the stage.]

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Uh, yes, here I am, OK, now, hello there. 
                         Now, we all know telescopes allow us 
                         to see distant objects. But what if 
                         we want to smell distant objects? Well 
                         now we can! Thanks to my new invention...the 
                         Smellescope.
 
               
               [He puts a piece of paper on a projector. The audience starts 
               talking.]

                         The odour travels past this coffee stain 
                         here, around the olive pit and into 
                         this cigar burn. And this appears to 
                         be a, doodle of myself as a cowboy. 
                          But the Smellescope is brilliant, I 
                         tell you! Think of the astronomical 
                         odours you'll smell thanks to me.  Oh, 
                         my!
 
               
               [He puts it back on the projector. It is smudged. The audience 
               laughs again.]

                         I've waited a hundred years for this, 
                         Farnsworth. I give your invention the 
                         worst grade imaginable: An A-minus-minus.

                         And now for the presentation of the 
                         award. Listen, folks, I'm practically 
                         giving this prize away to Dr. Wernstrom, 
                         for his fish thingy.
 
               
               [Wernstrom picks up the trophy and shakes his fish's leg. Farnsworth, 
               outside, sighs and walks away.]

                         Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a 
                         scientist.

                                     FRY
                         No, Professor, don't give up. There 
                         were plenty of times in my century when 
                         I was gonna give up but I never did. 
                         Never! Hey, are you even listening to 
                         me? Oh, I give up!
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         By God, you're right! I'm going to build 
                         that Smellescope!
 
               
               [Planet Express: Attic.]

               [Fry, Leela and Bender run in.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Did you build the Smellescope?

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         No, I remembered that I'd built one 
                         last year. Go ahead. Try it. You'll 
                         find that every heavenly body has its 
                         own particular scent. Here, I'll point 
                         it at Jupiter.
 
               
               [Fry sniffs.]

                         Smells like strawberries.

                         Exactly! And now Saturn.

                         Uranus.
 
               
               [He laughs.]

                                     FARNSWORTH
                         I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed 
                         Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke 
                         once and for all.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Oh. What's it called now?

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Urectum. Here, let me locate it for 
                         you.
 
               
               [Fry chuckles.]

                         No, no, I think I'll just smell around 
                         a bit over here!  Hmm.  Hmm.
 
               
               [He sniffs again and starts gagging.]

                         What is it?  Oh, jeez! Oh, man! Remarkable! 
                         A stench so foul is right off the funk-o-meter. 
                         I dare say Fry may have discovered the 
                         smelliest object in the known universe.

                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Hmm, perhaps the computer can calculate 
                         its trajectory.  My God! Whatever it 
                         is it's headed straight for us. With 
                         enough force to reduce this entire city 
                         to a stinky crater. We have less than 
                         72 hours.

                         Well, lets get looting!

                         So this thing's gonna destroy the whole 
                         city?  What the heck is it?
 
               
               [Farnsworth taps a keyboard.]

                         Ah! Just as I thought. The answer lies 
                         in this movie I found on the Internet.

                          New York City: the year 2000. The most 
                         wasteful society in the history of the 
                         galaxy and it was running out of places 
                         to empty its never-ending output of 
                         garbage.  The landfills were full. New 
                         Jersey was full. And so, under cover 
                         of darkness, the city put its garbage 
                         out to sea on the world's largest barge. 
                          The repulsive barge circled the oceans 
                         for 50 years but no country would accept 
                         it. Not even that really filthy one. 
                         You know the one I mean. Finally, in 
                         2052, the city used its mob connections 
                         to obtain a rocket and launch the garbage 
                         into outer space. Some experts claim 
                         the ball might return to Earth someday, 
                         but their concerns were dismissed as 
                         "depressing".

                         short-sightedness of Old New York, New 
                         New York is going to be destroyed by 
                         a giant ball of garbage.

                         back then? How could you just throw 
                         your garbage away?

                         I thank you, Professor Farnsworth. I 
                         now present you with the Academy prize, 
                         which we confiscated from Dr. Wernstrom

                         Bender clean up his act then I think 
                         we should be supportive.

                         There's nothing I can do. Now, if you'll 
                         just sign this fiddle contest waiver.

                         The Fairness In Hell Act of 2275 requires 
                         me to inform you that if you can best 
                         me in a fiddle contest, you win back 
                         Bender's soul. As well as a solid gold 
                         fiddle.

                         Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds 
                         of pounds and sound crummy?
 
               
                                     ROBOT DEVIL
                         Well it's mostly for show.

               
               [He picks up the fiddle and it glints in the light.]

                         (whispering) Do you know how to play 
                         the fiddle?

                         (whispering) No, do you?

               
                                     LEELA
                         (whispering) No, but I used to play 
                         the drums. They're sorta similar. (talking) 
                         What happens if we lose?
 
               
                                     ROBOT DEVIL
                         You'll only win a smaller, silver fiddle. 
                         Also I guess I'll kill one of you, uh, 
                         him.
 
               
               [He points at Fry. Fry gulps.]

                         Very well, then. Beat this.

               shoot laser rings at them. Bender grabs a pair of a bugbots wings 
               and flies in and grabs Fry and Leela who are swarmed by a crowd 
               of Hellbots with pitchforks. Bender ascends and heads for small 
               hole in the roof.]

               [A bugbot shoots three laser rings at the trio. Two miss but 
               one catches on Bender's antenna, forming a halo. The Hallejulah 
               chorus plays and they get closer to the hole. Hellbots pull chains 
               to close the hole.]

                         good or too evil again. From now on, 
                         I'll just be me.

                         less evil than that.

                         survive a 700ft fall?

                         (shouting) No. Luckily a family broke 
                         my fall.

                         Just hang on! I'll take care of that 
                         fire!

               [Cut to: Titanic Room. Bender lands in the middle of the room 
               and sprays the flames with water, extinguishing the fire. He 
               leaves the hose and hugs the Countess.]

                         Bender, you risked your life to save 
                         me.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third 
                         time. But that would be it.  When we 
                         kiss, I feel like I'm standing waist 
                         deep in a pool of cold, rising water.
 
                         
               
               [They both look down and see they are standing waist deep in 
               a pool of cold, rising water. They scream and shout as it gets 
               closer to their heads.]

               [There is a crash and the emergency airlock begins to close. 
               The crew rush forward to get under it. Zoidberg dives and wedges 
               his claw under it. It stops moving. Leela tries to lift it.]

               a dish cover with some spoons. Hermes squeezes under the door.

                         Wait a second. Aren't you a member of 
                         the yacht club?

                         Thank God there are plenty of escape 
                         pods; We won't have to dress up like

                         for Bender. The high gravity must be 
                         slowing down his looting.

                         Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see 
                         it I'll think back to that moment when

               Titanic deck seals. Bender and the Countess leap from the deck, 
               smashing through the glass airlock.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Outside Escape Pod. Bender and the Countess float towards 
               the pod and Bender reaches out his hand.]

                         I'm slipping, Bender. The pull is too

                         No! You have too much to live for. It 
                         may hurt for a while but one day you'll 
                         share your love again. After all, it's 
                         shareware.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Don't talk like that. Tragic romances 
                         always have a happy ending.

                         But she saved all our lives. Without

                         Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows 
                         what happens in a black hole. It's possible 
                         she's still alive in another dimension 
                         somewhere. Right, Professor?

                         much like Utah. But unlike Utah, it

                         monkeys. You've got the hat.

                         cool and it makes me smart but it doesn't 
                         make me happy.

                         here, maybe you should just go back 
                         to the jungle.

                         elected a super-villain governor, and

                         It may well be the cause of Bender's 
                         illness. But more importantly, it's 
                         a flimsy pretext to try out my latest

                         I call this the F-ray. It's like an 
                         X-ray only it allows you to see through 
                         anything - even metal. Now, the neutrino 
                         beam it emits is a tad dangerous, so 
                         you'll all need protective goggles.

               creatures across the river carrying barrels of Slurm. They have 
               orange faces and green hair and look like the Oompa-Loompas from

                         see our mix-ologists at work.  They 
                         take 900 of the finest ingredients, 
                         add a touch of child-like delight and 
                         mix it all with glacial spring water 
                         from our glacial spring water generator.

                         ingredient that makes Slurm so deliciously 
                         addictive.

                         And why is the Slurm pouring into this 
                         sewer?
 
               
               [Fry wrings some Slurm from his hair into his mouth and spits 
               it straight out.]

               door and they peer around it. It is the door from earlier that 
               was marked "Keep Out". On the other side one of the worm guards 
               smokes while another knits. A Grunka Lunka sleeps and two others

                         super Slurm!  It's so delicious, you'll 
                         eat until you explode! Oh, which reminds 
                         me, put a tarp over that sofa, will 
                         you? Bon appétit!
 
               
               [One of the Glurmos forces a spoonful of the Slurm into Fry's 
               mouth. Fry struggles then smiles.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Mmm!

               
                                     SLURM QUEEN
                         Farewell! Oh, and congratulations again 
                         on winning the contest.
 
               
               [She and the Glurmos laugh insanely and leave.]

                         Fry, untie us, quick!

               
                                     FRY
                         Here I come.  Let me just-- One more 
                         taste.
 
               
               [He takes three.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         You pig. Stop stuffing your craw and 
                         save us.
 
               
               [Fry walks towards her then changes his mind and sticks his head 
               into the tub. Bender moves closer to the machine.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         I can't see what's happening. Are we 
                         boned?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Yeah, we're boned.

               
               [Fry lifts his head out of the tub and looks around. He sees 
               Bender then Leela then looks back at the Slurm, A tear trickles 
               down his face and splashes into the Slurm.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         I can't stop eating this delicious ooze. 
                         But I'm not gonna let you die.
 
               
               [He moves towards the control unit, dragging the tub with him 
               and shovelling handfuls of Slurm into his mouth.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Hurry!

                         What's happening?  Just in time!

               
               [He looks down and screams. There is a hole in the middle of 
               his casing. Fry looks through it. While he is distracted, Leela 
               tips the tub of Slurm over and it disappears down a drain.]
 
               
               
                                     FRY
                         (screaming) Nooo!  (talking) I could 
                         fit if I didn't have these damn arms!
 
                         
               
               [He starts gnawing at his arms. Leela lifts him up off the floor.]
 
               
               
               [Wormulon Cave. The trio run through the tunnel.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         We're close to the exit. I can smell 
                         those filthy orange guys.
 
               
               [Ahead of them is Slurms MacKenzie and the babes.]

                         Slurms MacKenzie?

               
                                     SLURMS
                         Shh! I want you to take me with you.

                                     SLURMS
                         I'm partied out. All I want is to stay 
                         home and rent videos and watch them 
                         with a few friends. Is that so much 
                         to ask?
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Forget it pal.  It says on this bottle-cap 
                         you have to party with us.
 
               
                                     SLURMS
                         Alright, when we get to Earth. But please 
                         don't invite too many people, I wanna 
                         keep it small.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         No can do, Slurms!

               
               [He pats him on the back. The cave starts to shake and the Slurm 
               Queen bursts through the wall. Everyone screams.]
 
               
                                     SLURMS
                         This way!

               
               [He ushers them into another part of the cave. A sign above reads 
               "Danger Cave-In Area". The Slurm Queen follows but gets stuck. 
               She squirts some Slurm around her body as lubricant and squeezes 
               through.]

               [Slurms stops running.]

               
                                     SLURMS
                         Go on without me, I'll hold her off.
 
                         
               
               [Everyone else stops.]

                         But she'll crush you like a worm ... 
                         crushing a smaller worm.
 
               
                                     SLURMS
                         It's alright. I'm so tired of partying. 
                         So very tired.  I'll save you the only 
                         way I know how: By partying!  Babes.

                         You've served me well these 40 years, 
                         but this time I've got to party alone.
 
                         
               
                                     BABE

                                     SLURMS
                         There'll be other parties for you. Now 
                         go. Go!
 
               
               [They run away and Slurms dances and the Slurm Queen closes in. 
               The tunnel starts to collapse and Slurms turns the volume up 
               to maximum. More rocks fall from the roof. Bender turns around.]

               [Bigger rocks falls from above and they pile up in the tunnel. 
               One crushes Slurms and he yelps. The Slurm Queen slams into the 
               pile of rocks.]

                         secret!
 
               
               [She cries. The Glurmos arrive in time to see her drinking her

                         discovery: It seems that Slurm is produced 
                         in a colossal worm hiney!
 
               
               [On the screen, the commissioner sits in his office in front

                         testimony we'll finally be able to outlaw 
                         this insidious Slurm.

               they are chased by a dog (which is then eaten by the space monster 
               from The Empire Strikes Back). Back on Earth Sal delivers more 
               papers to them. At Maple Craters they pass Bret Blob's house.

                         believe humans really could mutate down 
                         there. Uh, due to exposure to toxic 
                         waste and radioactive runoff and good 
                         old American faeces.

                         feelings afterall.

                         anything from me, but I think I actually 
                         learned something from him.  (shouting)

               one of Zoidberg's people.]

                         Why, you're that disgraced starship 
                         captain.  Having him on staff will distract 
                         people from our horrendous safety record.

                          Anyway, whoever you all are, I have 
                         good news. You'll be making a delivery 
                         to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high 
                         gravity you'll most likely be crushed 
                         under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy.

                         working for that man. Once, he actually

                         a velour uniform. And I'm not convinced 
                         Leela has any of those things.

                         Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish 
                         she didn't make us work so much.

                         Back when I was captain all I asked 
                         from my men was their complete loyalty. 
                         If I had that, then for all I cared 
                         they could sit around the whole day 
                         drinking beer in their underpants.

                         I'd see the day. Come, Kif, let's eject.

                         wear.

                         with Captain Leela. She actually listens 
                         to what I have to--

                         Yes, but your body stayed on message. 
                         And that message is, "Look at my shiny 
                         new body". The robots ate it up. You've 
                         got real charisma from the neck down.

                         Xmas away from home.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Hey, hey. Let me aks you something: 
                         Would it cheer you up if we went and 
                         cut down an Xmas tree?

                         know, pine tree.
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Pine trees have been extinct for 800 
                         years, Fry. Gone the way of the poodle 
                         and your primitive notions of modesty.

               of the trunk. Amy takes a star out of a box and uses a jet pack 
               to get to the top of the tree. She hits her head on the ceiling.

                         get a fresh goose for goose burgers 
                         and my dad would whip up his special 
                         eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes. 
                          This dumb holiday just makes me think 
                         of all the things I left behind. Let's 
                         just stop talking about Xmas.

                         Zoidfarb.  Instead of "Claus" he writes 
                         "Claws"! Now that's humorous. Today's

                         puppies. And there would have to be

                         Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot Company 
                         built a robotic Santa to determine who'd 
                         be naughty and who'd been nice and distribute 
                         presents accordingly. But something 
                         went wrong.

                         Wait, you fool! Due to a programming 
                         error, Santa's standards were set too 
                         high and he invariably judges everyone 
                         to be naughty.

                         chop off your head and stuff your neck 
                         full of toys from his sack of horrors.

                         this way. Out of all of us he always 
                         seemed the most normal.

                         Edna, have you anything to say before 
                         begins the Claw-Plach?
 
               
                                     EDNA
                         I do. I just want to say that today 
                         I got up and I had a piece of toast. 
                         Then I brushed my teeth--

                         Fry, having guessed what animal I was 
                         thinking of, you shall have first choice 
                         of weapon.  And you, doctor?
 
               
                                     ZOIDBERG

                         pleasure of chopping him right here 
                         in the gonads!

                         Fry, I've never asked you for anything 
                         before but if it's not too much trouble, 
                         when it comes to the ninth round just 
                         let him win.

               around and Fry does the same with his nutcrackers and whacks 
               himself in the eye. Zoidberg scratches a "Z" in Fry's shirt à 
               la The Mark of Zorro then scratches "DR" above it. Fry squeals 
               and backs away. A bright light starts to shine in his eye. He 
               squints and tries to avoid it.]

               lands in the mud and Fry chuckles. Zoidberg stands on his hands, 
               kicks off his sandals and starts chasing Fry, clacking at him 
               with his foot claws. The crowds cheer.]

                         or its dumb customs. But is squeezing 
                         each others brains out with a giant

                         I'd never felt before: Love, jealousy, 
                         passion for disembowling. I owe it all

                         to Europa? We could have a picnic and

                         we sort of think exactly alike, and 
                         junk.

                         out. Hangin out? She's getting way too

                         us, I can't be alone with her.

                         chocolate but then you start to get 
                         tired of it because it always wants

                         banking regulations are a product of 
                         five different regulatory traditions.

                         But on my planet, we have to suffer

                         of a doctor -- If you want your parents 
                         to roll over in their graves!

                         my opponent here.  But I am a veteran 
                         who has fought for his planet. You see 
                         this hand of mine?

                         No, you don't  'Cause I lost my real 
                         hand plantin' the flag when we took 
                         back Halley's Comet! Yet it was worth 
                         it. So much do I love that flag.  I 
                         love it even more than I love my seven 
                         wives. That's right, I'm a polygamist. 
                          Yet I would gladly eat a flag myself, 
                         had I not used my intestine as a rope 
                         to hoist a flag made of my own skin, 
                         if it would protect the freedoms of 
                         the proud people who salute that flag. 
                          Freedom such as polygamy.  I rest my 
                         case.  Whoa, jeez!

                         six to three, we find that flag eating

                         is too much to bear......when even an

                         cream I bought from a travelling salesman.

                         right up!" This sounds too good to be 
                         true I thought. He said I looked like 
                         a smart young man. "So is it a deal?" 
                         I enquired. Two hours later he was gone, 
                         with 60 of my dollars. But I have the

                         don't care if you're not the most important 
                         person in the universe. It really makes 
                         me happy to see you right now.

                         Then I am the most important person 
                         in the universe.

                         A hush comes over the crowd. The only 
                         sound is Bender calling everyone else 
                         a jerk and he swings!  And he slices 
                         it into the water, oh man!

                         Because. And says me. It's an extremely 
                         dangerous mission that killed my last 
                         crew. And you're not nearly as good

                         This is no ordinary honey. It's produced 
                         by vicious space bees. A single sting

               the tunnels and Bender hangs onto the queen's sting screaming.

                         pain was so intense that it felt to 
                         him like 15 years. And it goes without 
                         saying that it caused him to empty his 
                         bowels.  We now commend Fry's body to

                         If Fry is out there then Leela's brain 
                         could be acting as a five pound ouija 
                         board.

                         Some sort yes. In France it's called 
                         a "guillotine."

                         without removing it?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Yes. Easily.

                         when we buried him? Y'know like Julia 
                         Roberts?

                         No. According to this gizmometer, Fry 
                         is dead and nothing can bring him back!

                         that! How could I have know the gift 
                         was in Fry's locker?

                         died! And your grief roasted mind blocked 
                         it out.

                         Two weeks. Fry never left your side 
                         for a minute.

                         And he talked non-stop, like a parrot 
                         of the sea he was.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         I though that if you heard a familiar 
                         voice, it might help keep your mind 
                         together. But, who knows if it really 
                         got through.

                         It got through Fry.  It got through.
