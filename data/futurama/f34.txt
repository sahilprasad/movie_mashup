                         a lot of things right now and-- Look, 
                         Zoidberg, I carry more eggs than any 
                         other female and I owe it to our race 
                         to pick a mate who's stuffed with male 
                         jelly. Maybe a rock star.

                         you again.

                         from the blowhole of that hideous alien?

                         Zoidberg's really great. He's got male 
                         jelly coming out the wazoo.

                         magical words were really yours. Teach

               [In the arena Zoidberg takes a dive at Fry and Fry dodges. Zoidberg 
               lands in the mud and Fry chuckles. Zoidberg stands on his hands, 
               kicks off his sandals and starts chasing Fry, clacking at him 
               with his foot claws. The crowds cheer.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         (shouting) Come on, Fry! Die with dignity!
 
                         
               
               [Zoidberg carries on chasing Fry.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Aha!  Oops!

               
               [He grabs Zoidberg around the neck with the nutcrackers and Zoidberg 
               grabs Fry's neck with his claws locking the two together in a 
               struggle.]
 
               
                                     EDNA
                         (screaming) Nooo! I can't stand to look.
 
                         
               
               [Zoidberg looks up at her.]

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Huh?

               
               [Fry dodges his grasp and gains the upper hand by grabbing him 
               from behind with the nutcrackers and bringing him to his knees. 
               The crowd chants.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Psst, Fry. Take a dive.

               
               [Fry grins and tightens the nutcrackers. Sweat pours down Zoidberg's 
               face and the crowd chants.]
 
               
                                     CROWD
                         (chanting) Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! 
                          Claw-Plach!  Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach!
 
                         
               
               [The crowd gasps.]

               
                                     FRY
                         My fellow fish monsters. Far be it for 
                         me to question your stupid civilisation 
                         or its dumb customs. But is squeezing 
                         each others brains out with a giant 
                         nutcracker really going to solve anything? 
                         Dr. Zoidberg is my friend. And though 
                         a woman has come between us, I say we'll 
                         always remain friends. And you know 
                         why?  One reason.
 
               
               [Zoidberg cuts his arm off with one clean click of the claws. 
               Fry looks at his lifeless arm on the ground and pulls his shirt 
               up around his wound.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         You bastard! I'll kill you! You bastard!
 
                         
               
               [He picks up his dismembered arm and starts beating Zoidberg 
               around the head with it. Zoidberg kicks him away and starts to 
               choke him.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone.

               
               [Zoidberg looks around the empty arena.]

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Edna? Honey?

               
               [Cut to: Decapod 10 Beach. The mating frenzy meter has filled 
               with water.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Claw-Plach Arena. They hear the craws of Decapodians.]
 
               
               
               [Cut to: Decapod 10 Beach. They run to the beach and gasp.]
 
               
               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Edna?

               
               [Edna and the emperor are holding claws. They scuttle into the 
               water along with thousands of other Decapods. They all disappear 
               underwater and the sea fills with a green slime.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Ew!

               
                                     BENDER
                         Oh, my God!

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         The frenzy!  Oh, the greatest experience 
                         in life and I missed it.
 
               
               [He bursts into tears.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Aw. I'm sorry, Doc.

               
               [He pats him on the back with his severed arm.]

               
               [Time Lapse. The four walk along the empty beach and seagulls 
               fly around them. Zoidberg injects Fry with some St. Jonah's Morphine 
               For Children.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Ow, ow! Ah!

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         The frenzy is over. How will I ever 
                         get rid of my male jelly now?
 
               
                                     FRY
                          I'll lend you this.

               
                                     LEELA
                         Fry!

               
               [A seagull grabs his arm and tries to pull it away from Fry.]
 
               
               
                                     FRY
                         Hey, hey.

               
               [Bender is covered in bird faeces.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         Shoo! Get away! Hey! What's with the 
                         flying jerks?
 
               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         They come to feast after the frenzy. 
                         Once my species passes on its genes, 
                         it dies.
 
               
               [He points to the sea which is littered with the corpses of Decapodians.]
 
               
               
                                     FRY
                         You mean you have to choose between 
                         a life without sex and a gruesome death?
 
                         
               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Yes.

               
                                     FRY
                         Tough call.

               
               [The ship flies away from Decapod 10.]

               
               [Cut to: Ships Medical Room.]

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Well it was nice of you to let me reattach 
                         your arm, Fry. Especially after I made 
                         a complete eel out of myself.
 
               
               [Fry is lying on a table while Leela and Bender watch. He shrugs.]
 
               
               
                                     FRY
                         No biggie.

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Yes biggie. I learned to feel things 
                         I'd never felt before: Love, jealousy, 
                         passion for disembowling. I owe it all 
                         to you.  There! I pronounce the operation 
                         a success.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Hooray!

               
                                     BENDER
                         Yeah!

               
                                     FRY
                         (laughing) Yeah!

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         I may not know from emotions but when 
                         it comes to medicine, forget about it.
 
                         
               
               [Fry look at his arm.]

               
                                     FRY
                         I don't mean to nitpick, super-doc, 
                         but do you think maybe you could take 
                         one more whack at this?
 
               
               [He points at his arm. Zoidberg has attached it to his other 
               arm so he has two on the same side. Zoidberg turns around with 
               his laser-saw.]
 
               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         For you, my friend, anything.

               
               [The ship flies towards Earth. Fry screams from inside.]

               
                                     FRY
                         (from ship) My legs!

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         (from ship) Alright, alright, third 
                         time's the charm.
 
               
               [He saws again and another limb falls off and splats.]
