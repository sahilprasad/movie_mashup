                         Perhaps. But there is more to winning 
                         than beating your opponent. You lack

                         bout. Destructor, a robotic armoured

                         ruled a war crime versus, Gender Bender,

                         This could be the most one-sided fight 
                         since 1973 when Ali faced an 80-foot 
                         tall mechanical Joe Frazier. M-My memory's 
                         not what it used to be but I think the 
                         entire Earth was destroyed.

                         A bet of $0 on Bender pays $1000 if 
                         he wins. Still, very few takers.

                         Bender? How did the fight go? I heard 
                         somebody got flattened!
 
               
                                     AMY
                         Fry, where's your Brain Slug?

               
               [Farnsworth picks up the limp alien from the floor.]

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Poor little guy starved to death.

               
                                     LEELA
                         I'm proud of you, Bender. Sure, you 
                         lost. You lost bad. But the important 
                         thing is I beat up someone who hurt 
                         my feelings in high school.
 
               
               [She chuckles.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         I'm in tremendous pain here.

               
               [Doubledeal pushes through.]

               
                                     DOUBLEDEAL
                         Great job, kid. You lost and you made 
                         it look almost half real. I want you 
                         to have this card good for 10% off at 
                         Bed Bath & Beyond.
 
               
               [He puts it in Bender's chest cabinet and leaves.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         Yes! I'm the greatest! The greatest!
 
                         
               
               [He groans. Leela rolls him up and she and Fry carry him off.]
 
               
               
                                     LITTLE
                         And so ends the chronicle of one of 
                         the greatest ever to play the sport.
 
                         
               
                                     FOREMAN
                         And he didn't look half bad in the tutu.
 
                         
               
                                     LITTLE
                         That he did surely not.

               
                                     FOREMAN
                         What?
