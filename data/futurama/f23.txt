                         might be happier with gills?

                         what you mean.

                         So after I specifically asked you not 
                         to touch anything, you drank a bottle 
                         of strange blue liquid? It could have

                         octopus ate all his acorns and also 
                         he got a racecar. Is any of this getting

                         finally switch to hard liquor!

                         Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in 
                         a high-speed centrifuge separating out 
                         the denser fluid of His Highness.

                         always forget about the bones.

                         I could vomit or urinate. Would you 
                         feel better about that?

                         Slightly. But my favourite so far is 
                         the bone-crushing.

                         Fine. That or the bone one.

                         too macho.

                         'cause there's no God and your idiotic 
                         human ideals are laughable!

               [Fry sits in his throne but a splashing noise from outside attracts 
               the others to the window.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Wait a second. Here comes Leela.

               
               [Cut to: Outside Trisol Palace. Leela kicks her way through the 
               crowd of Trisolian guards, splashing them to oblivion. They swarm 
               her.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Trisol Palace Throne Room.]

               
                                     AMY
                         Oh, no. They have her totally outnumbered.
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         I can't believe it. She's risking her 
                         life for me after the way I treated 
                         her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.
 
                         
               
                                     BENDER
                         You do? Hmm.

               
                                     FRY
                         Is she alright?

               
                                     BENDER
                         I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out 
                         this window. Oh, dear God in heaven, 
                         they're swarming all over her.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         No. No!

               
                                     AMY
                         What are you talking about, Bender? 
                         She's al --  (muffled) Oh!
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, 
                         they're putting some ice cubes in the 
                         glass under it.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         This can't be happening.

               
                                     BENDER
                         It can and, for all you know, it is. 
                          I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead.
 
               
               [Fry starts to cry and Amy catches his tear in the bottle.]
 
               
               
                                     FRY
                         All Leela ever wanted to do was help 
                         me. But I was to proud, too stupid to 
                         accept it.  I wish I had died instead 
                         of her.
 
               
               [He starts to cry. Enter Leela via the window.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         What are you talking about?

               
               [Fry stops crying.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Leela! You're alive!

               
                                     LEELA
                         Of course I'm alive.

               
                                     BENDER
                         I told Fry you were dead so he would 
                         cry out the Emperor but you had to go 
                         and wreck it by surviving.
 
               
                                     AMY
                         We only got two drops.

               
               [There is a bang at the door. The Trisolians begin leaking in 
               through a hole. Bont chuckles.]
 
               
                                     BONT
                         It's only a matter of time now.

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         I'll handle this!

               
               [He tries to block the leak with his claw and eventually gets 
               it under control by forcing one of his mouth flaps into the hole.]
 
               
               
                                     LEELA
                         Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out 
                         of this if you're willing to let me 
                         help you.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take 
                         all the help you're willing to give. 
                         I know you just want what's best for 
                         me.  Ow! What was that for?  Hey, come 
                         on!  That hurt!
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         I know. Amy, get the bottle.

               
               [She carries on beating Fry up while Amy holds the bottle under 
               his eye.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         (crying) Oh, now I understand.

               
                                     LEELA
                         Come on. Everybody help out Fry.

               
               [She slaps him again, Zoidberg pinches his leg with his claw 
               and Bender stubs out a cigar on his arm.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         (crying) Thanks, everybody. I love you 
                         all. You guys are true -- ow! Cut it 
                         out, Bender! That's a tender area!
 
                         
               
                                     LEELA
                         How we doing, Amy?

               
                                     AMY
                         Great! We're one-tenth of the way there.
 
                         
               
               [Time Lapse. Leela, Zoidberg and Bender are tired out. Amy keeps 
               kicking the Emperor out of Fry. She pants.]
 
               
                                     AMY
                         OK, it's your turn.

               
               [She points to someone. A Trisolian starts to hit Fry with a 
               chair.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?

               
                                     BONT
                         I'm the Emperor! Thanks for crying me 
                         out.
 
               
               [Fry looks at his stomach and sees it's back to normal.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Oh, you're welcome.

               
               [Bont hits him with the chair again.]

               
               [Cut to: Outside Trisolian Palace. The crowds have gone. Fry 
               cries in pain from inside.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                          Hey! Save some for me!
