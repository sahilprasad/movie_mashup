                         again infiltrated the Infosphere and 
                         set off his amazing bomb. Only this 
                         time...

                         Thank you for saving the universe Fry. 
                          Here.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Whoa, thanks! If you ever need a saviour 
                         again, just ask.

                         Man, I can't wait to tell everyone what 
                         happened.
 
               
                                     NIBBLER
                         Uh yes. Incidentally I need to remain 
                         undercover so I'm blanking your memory.

                         Huh. Did everything just taste purple 
                         for a second? Oh well. Let's go home 
                         you dumb poop machine.

                         Oh. Thank you. You know what Fry. I 
                         don't care if you're not the most important 
                         person in the universe. It really makes 
                         me happy to see you right now.

                         Then I am the most important person 
                         in the universe.
