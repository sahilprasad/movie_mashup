                         I am the Grand Midwife.

                         Hi!

               
                                     KIF
                         I am Kif of the clan Kroker. I come 
                         to bear my young.
 
               
                                     MIDWIFE
                         Then let the Tea Of New Life be brewed. 
                          As it is written "and both shall lift 
                         the jug together". Where is your smizmar?
 
                         
               
                                     KIF
                         She's not with me.

               
                                     MIDWIFE
                         Oh the sorrow. Oh the shame. I'm sorry 
                         I'm probably just making you feel worse.
 
                         
               
                                     KIF
                         As long as Amy is with me in my heart 
                         I will have the strength of two.  Apparently 
                         Amy hasn't been working out much lately.
 
                         
               
               [He drags it a little way.]

               
                                     MIDWIFE
                         As the tea boils please join hands with 
                         your beloved smizmar.  Oh right sorry, 
                         but I memorised the ceremony by heart 
                         and it mentions her a lot.
 
               
                                     KIF
                         I'll try to endure.

               
                                     MIDWIFE
                         Good 'cause I'm not changing it. Now 
                         turn ye to and gaze deeply into each 
                         other's eyes.
 
               
               [Kif looks at Bender.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         What are you looking at?

               
                                     MIDWIFE
                         May the love I sense between you at 
                         this moment remain with you both for 
                         all your days.  The Tea Of New Life 
                         is ready. Let those who's love created 
                         this life speak each other's names, 
                         then drink.
 
               
               [Kif looks into the cup and cries.]

               
                                     KIF
                         Amy.

               
                                     AMY (SHOUTING)
                         Kif!

               
               [Everyone looks up and gasps. Amy flies towards the swamp on 
               her party/ironing board.]
 
               
                                     KIF
                         Amy! Is it you or have I gone crazy 
                         with lonliness?
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Both.

               
               [Amy lands and falls off.]

               
                                     AMY
                         I still don't know if I'm ready for 
                         this but, I do know I love you. And 
                         I wanna be here beside you.
 
               
                                     MIDWIFE
                         Great! Now I lost my place! I'm starting 
                         over!
 
               
               [Kif's bump rumbles.]

               
                                     KIF
                         Oh no time! It has begun!  Oh my!

               
               [Everyone else cringes at what is happening. Bender pulls out 
               a camera and takes a photo.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Neat!

               
                                     AMY
                         You can do it Kif!

               
               [Kif pushes again.]

               
                                     KIF
                         Oh nearly!

               
               [He pushes some more and eventually some spawn comes from between 
               his legs and makes a huge splash. Leela, Fry and Zapp cover their 
               noses.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Aww man!

               
               [Some one and two eyed tadpoles hop out from the spawn and head 
               for the swamp.]
 
               
                                     KIF
                         Amy my love, tell me, are they making 
                         it to the water?
 
               
               [Some snakes and flying things surround the tadpoles. Leela breaks 
               a huge leaf off a plant and throws it to Amy.]

                         Amy!

               
               [Amy catches it and starts beating back the animals.]

               
                                     AMY
                         Shoo! Stay away from my babies!

               
               [A flying thing picks a tadpole up. Amy smacks it with the leaf 
               and the tadpole falls to the ground. The rest of the animals 
               turn around and the tadpoles hop into the water.]
 
               
                                     MIDWIFE
                         The birthing is complete!

               
               [Everyone cheers and gathers around Kif and Amy.]

                         I will now take my leave. I live here 
                         so I won't actually be going anywhere 
                         but you don't have to talk to me anymore.

                         There goes my DNA. What a disgusting 
                         and beautiful process.

                         Well we've given them a great start 
                         Amy. And in 20 years they'll sprout 
                         legs and crawl back onto land as children.

                         And I'll be ready then.

               
               [They hug and watch their children swim around in the swamp. 
               Two leap into the air and bump their heads.]
