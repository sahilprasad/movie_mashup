                         Look at that. The carts go out full 
                         but they come in empty. It's criminally 
                         inefficient.

                         efficiency 4% if they used the empty 
                         carts to haul in heavy mining machinery.

                         That's only four minutes from now.

               (singing) When I was born there was a hurricane in Kingston Town
 
               
               With a foot and a half of water.

               Everyone was alright but I cried all night

               It blew my alphabet blocks out of order.

               And they said "This boy's born to be a bureaucrat,

               Born to be all obsessive and snotty."

               I made my friends and relations file long applications

               To get into my 10th birthday party.

               
               [He scoops up some red tubes, slides down a tube and drops them 
               into some filing cabinets. LaBarbara pop up from one of them.]

                         He forgot that it's not about badges 
                         and ranks.
 
               
                                     HERMES (SINGING)
                         It's supposed to be about the filing! 
                         People!
 
               
               [He jumps onto Number 1.0's desk and starts juggling the tubes.]
 
               
               
               We didn't choose to be bureaucrats,

               No that's what almighty Jah made us!

               We treat people like swine,

               And make 'em stand in line,

               Even if nobody paid us!

               
               [He dives off the desk into the pile of red tubes.]

               
               They say the world looks down on the bureaucrats,

               They say we're anal, compulsive and weird.

               But when push comes to shove,

               You gotta do what you love,

               Even if it's not a good idea! [He slides down the pile and throws 
               the red tubes around the crew like a knife thrower.] Zoidberg!

                         have some changes to make. First, Fry,

                         That form isn't about you. It refers 
                         to my high school prom date. It was 
                         a regulation date that ended in regulation
