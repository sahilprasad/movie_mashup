                         Of course, since the greenhouse gases 
                         are still building up, it takes more

                         stop global warming at the same time! 
                         Granted you're all blasting out greenhouse

                         But we can use those very gases to save 
                         the planet. If you all vent your exhaust 
                         directly upward in one burst it should 
                         thrust the Earth further from the sun, 
                         thus cooling it.  By my calculations 
                         we'll need the full force of every last 
                         robot. So quickly, everyone point your 
                         exhaust vents straight upwards.  Now 
                         vent! Vent like the wind!  Harder! Harder!

               and brings it back into the vent. Fry groans from the heat.]

                         The person who gave up her whole evening 
                         to watch it. A whole evening of TV gone. 
                         What a mockery of justice it is that

                         But then again, I promised the coin

                         Wait a minute. If our universes are 
                         identical then why did our Leela look 
                         into the box and your Leela didn't?

                         Well to be honest I tossed a coin. It 
                         came up tails so I didn't look.

                         Interesting. Apparently the key difference 
                         between our universes is that coin flips 
                         have opposite outcomes.

                         Well then there's only one solution.

                         ...Have you ever tried simply turning 
                         off the TV, sitting down with your children, 
                         and hitting them?

                         Well, I'd say we all learned a valuable 
                         lesson about TV there.

                         Uh...that we should all take TV a little 
                         less seriously. And more importantly, 
                         turn it off once in a while.

                         made me smart? I could play the holophonor 
                         and it made Leela like me.  Hey Bender, 
                         as long as you know, I have a holophonor 
                         recital Tuesday and I'd really like

                         soul. Then one day I found someone else's 
                         couch fibres on his butt.

                         naked on her couch if I could just learn 
                         to play this stupid thing.

                         to metaphorically make a "deal with

                         Ah Fry, congratulations. Your latest 
                         performance was as delectable as dipping 
                         my bottom over and over into a bath 
                         of the silkiest oils and creams!
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Thank you sir, that's exactly what I 
                         was going for.
 
               
                                     HEDONISMBOT
                         You were the sole diversion in what 
                         has been a pale and unamusing season. 
                         And so I would feign commission you 
                         write an opera.

                         But, I've never written an opera.

                         And I've never heard one. Still, if 
                         you can keep me amused through the overture 
                         I shall consider it a smashing success.

                         But I wouldn't even know what to write 
                         about. Unless...  OK I'll do it. If 
                         I can make it about Leela.

                         shall see you at the premiere.

               the sound. She sees holographic silhouettes coming from underneath 
               a door like Bender did in the apartment.]

               notes on a music sheet.]

                         I-I don't want you to hear it 'til it's 
                         done.

                         'til it's cooked. This has to be perfect. 
                         I want you to hear exactly what I hear

                         incredible gift and I never knew. I've 
                         been a fool. A fully justified prudent 
                         fool.  They're so cold.

                         were my friend. But if you love your

                         Not necessarily. For the dog may yet 
                         survive.
 
               
                                     FRY

                         Indeed. You see, that fossil was made 
                         of dolomite. The tough black mineral 
                         that won't cop out when there's heat 
                         all about. By contrast, observe the 
                         lava's affect on this ice swan.  Of 
                         course, that would have melted even 
                         at room temperature. I just wanted to 
                         get rid of it. But had it been made 
                         of that righteous mineral dolomite, 
                         there's a slim chance it might have 
                         survived.

                         baby!

                         Think about it. Seymour lived a full 
                         life after I was gone. He probably added 
                         new songs to his repertoire.

                         when I knew him and that's when I loved 
                         him.  I'll never forget him. But he 
                         forgot me a long long time ago.

               the film Les Parapluies de Cherbourg plays. Seymour sits outside 
               Panucci's Pizza waiting for Fry to come back. It changes to summer, 
               then autumn, a snowy and rainy winter and back to spring. Panucci 
               gives Seymour a slice of pizza. It goes through autumn and winter 
               again. Seymour starts to age a little. The "U" from the "Panucci's 
               Pizza" sign falls on a man. An aged Panucci pats Seymour on the 
               head. Seymour continues waiting for Fry to return, and closes 
               his eyes...]

                         a body part and a planet and I've taken 
                         a bullet in it, on it. All to keep our

                         but I'll fight tooth and nail for his 
                         freedom to do it. Or I would if I hadn't 
                         lost my teeth and nails on Mars and

                         hand plantin' the flag when we took 
                         back Halley's Comet! Yet it was worth

                         love it even more than I love my seven 
                         wives. That's right, I'm a polygamist. 
                          Yet I would gladly eat a flag myself, 
                         had I not used my intestine as a rope 
                         to hoist a flag made of my own skin, 
                         if it would protect the freedoms of 
                         the proud people who salute that flag. 
                          Freedom such as polygamy.  I rest my 
                         case.  Whoa, jeez!

                         responsibilty.

                         searching, questing and shortly, it 
                         will wren my loins into way and pull

                         Well now it's your choice. Is there 
                         nothing in the future worth saving?

                         Swollen with nectar I trust?

                         we can build a hive and make more honey 
                         ourselves. Let me just pack her a lunch

                         death took only 15 seconds. Yet the 
                         pain was so intense that it felt to 
                         him like 15 years. And it goes without 
                         saying that it caused him to empty his 
                         bowels.  We now commend Fry's body to 
                         the ages.

                         me in my locker. If it's true then he 
                         must still exist in some form.

                         is dead and nothing can bring him back!

                         must be. I just wish I could convince

                         What happened? Why am I in my apartment?
 
                         
               
               [Farnsworth's, Zoidberg's, Hermes' and Amy's faces appear on 
               her walls.]

                         OK, I'm insane! But I'm still sane enough 
                         to know it.  The only time I feel alright 
                         is in my dreams. With you.  Three spoonfuls. 
                         Then I can dream forever.  One.  Two 
                          Here goes. Goodbye waking world.

               talking.]

                         Leela! No!  Listen to me, you don't 
                         want to lie in bed like a vegetable 
                         and do nothing the rest of your life. 
                         I've tried it. Bedsores hurt!

                         You can! The Leela I know doesn't give 
                         up this easily.

                         OK. I'll try.  Go away!

               
               [She throws the jar at it. The jar and the bee break and the 
               one bee becomes a swarm. Leela picks up Fry's photo and holds 
               it tightly.]

                         but there's something I wanna tell you. 
                         I love you.

                         I'm so scared Fry I don't know what 
                         to do.

                         up.

               side. His jacket is draped around her and she is in a coma.]

                         Of course I'm awake. You wouldn't stop 
                         waking me.  Where am I?

                         In the hospital. The ambulance brought 
                         you here right after the bee stung you.

                         me.

                         Stinger went right through me and you 
                         got all the poison. My new spleen came 
                         from a guy who liked to motorcycle.

                         Two weeks. Fry never left your side 
                         for a minute.

                         And he talked non-stop, like a parrot 
                         of the sea he was.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         I though that if you heard a familiar 
                         voice, it might help keep your mind 
                         together. But, who knows if it really 
                         got through.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         It got through Fry.  It got through.
