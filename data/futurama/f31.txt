               one of Zoidberg's people.]

                         I'd like everyone to meet our new employees.

                         Hmm, I could swear I've never seen that 
                         robot before either.

                         Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course. 
                          Anyway, whoever you all are, I have 
                         good news. You'll be making a delivery 
                         to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high 
                         gravity you'll most likely be crushed 
                         under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy.

                         sensuous woman but what manner of captain 
                         is she?

                         I see. Does she by any chance give the 
                         crewmembers spankings?

                         some sort of bare-bottom spanking policy 
                         let me go in your place. I won't have

                         knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly.

                         make a girdle as well? I ask because 
                         a friend of mine--

                         The point is, it's just so humiliating 
                         working for that man. Once, he actually 
                         ordered me to ... shave his armpits 
                         while he was in the bathtub. So, I said--

                         dolly, we could have broken it, given 
                         up and gone home by now.

                         a velour uniform. And I'm not convinced

                         Oh, no! He's disabled the steering. 
                          We're gonna crash!

                         Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess 
                         ... and my banjo.  And Fry.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         OK, OK. We have one chance. Are you 
                         willing to do what I say as captain?

                         Absolutely.

               
                                     LEELA
                         Even if I make you work hard?

               
                                     BENDER
                         As your God is my witness.

                         Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't 
                         break and load all the dark matter into 
                         the left engine.

                         wouldn't worry about it.

                         my quick thinking allowed me to do whatever

                         take him back we can keep him as captain.

                         incompetence, Zapp's cat-like reflexes, 
                         the stuff that made no sense, all of
