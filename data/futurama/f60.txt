                         We can make out together.

                         Gee Mavis, your house is across the 
                         street, that's an awfully long way to 
                         go for making out.

                         Did you notice what went wrong in that 
                         scene? Ordinarily Billy would work hard 
                         to make money from his paper route then 
                         he'd use the money to buy dinner for 
                         Mavis, thus earning the slim chance 
                         of performing the reproductive act. 
                         But in a world where teens can date 
                         robots why should he bother? Why should 
                         anyone bother? Let's take a look at 
                         Billy's planet a year later.  Where 
                         are all the football stars?  And where 
                         are the biochemists?  They are trapped 
                         - trapped in a soft, vice-like grip 
                         of robot lips. All civilisation was 
                         just an effort to impress the opposite 
                         sex. And sometimes the same sex. Now, 
                         let's skip forward 80 years into the 
                         future. Where is Billy?

                         of Billy's planet? It was Earth. Don't

                         People magazine, you'll blank out that 
                         robot.
 
               
               [Fry starts to cry. The Liubot flickers.]

               
                                     FRY
                         I'm sorry. Hug me Liubot.

               
               [She does. Fry reaches behind her hair and presses the erase 
               button.]
 
               
                                     LIUBOT
                         I'll always remember you Fry (mechanical 
                         voice) memory deleted.
 
               
               [Her image flickers away just leaving a battered blank robot.]
 
               
               
                                     BENDER
                         I know it hurts buddy. But at least 
                         you're not in a sick relationship with 
                         a robot anymore.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Uh huh. And I guess now maybe I can 
                         get to know the real Lucy Liu.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Pft! Yeah at our wedding!

               
                                     LIU
                         It's true. Bender and I are in love.
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         But, but!

               
                                     BENDER
                         Don't be a prude Fry!

               
               [He kisses Liu's jar while Fry looks on, eyes twitching.]
