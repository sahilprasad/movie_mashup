                         ...drive to Vegas, pick up some Flooziebots 
                         and void their warranties all night 
                         long!

                         Yay my buddy's home! And his respect 
                         for women is back to normal.

                         I kind of hope this whole experience 
                         would have left you a little more open 
                         to your sensitive side.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Yeah you'd think but what you gonna 
                         do?
 
               
               [He takes a puff from a cigar. On the TV it is raining and Calculon 
               holds Coilette in his arms..]

                         Coilette, the skies themselves weep 
                         upon the sweetest flower of all the 
                         field.

                         C'mon Bender let's go. This chick flick 
                         is getting me all barfy.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Yeah. Emotions are dumb and should be 
                         hated.
 
               
               [Fry leaves and he starts out after him. He stops and looks at 
               the TV.]

                         Goodnight Coilette, my turtledove.
 
                         
               
               [Bender's eyes well up with tears.]

                         What did you say?

               
                                     BENDER
                         I said you two don't dress trampy enough. 
                          I still got it!
