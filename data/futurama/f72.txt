                         This planet doesn't appreciate us anymore, 
                         Leonard.
 
               
                                     NIMOY
                         Bill, you are, and always shall be, 
                         my friend. But I just signed a six-month 
                         lease on my apartment. I can't walk 
                         away from a commitment like that.

                         Very well, my friend.

                         I'm literally angry with rage! Your 
                         co-stars may be gone but we can still 
                         get those episode tapes back for the 
                         whole world to see. Come on!

                         'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like 
                         how you should accept people, whether 
                         they be black, white, Klingon or even 
                         female. But most importantly, when I 
                         didn't have any friends, it made me 
                         feel like maybe I did.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I 
                         guess I can't let you go alone.

                         I'll go too, with Leonard's permission, 
                         of course.

               console exploding in his face like in Star Trek. Smoke comes 
               out of machinery and sparks fly.]

                         from our weapons.

                         happens.

                         of actors while you, a crew of genuine 
                         space heroes, risked your lives to save 
                         them.

                         of my fanatical devotion I shall pit 
                         you together against each other in armed

                         So Melllvar ordered a battle to the 
                         death. I assume no one survived.

                         you can find. But I warn you, do nothing 
                         until I have signalled the start of

                         I have an idea. Wasn't there an episode 
                         where I threw my shoe at the enemy?

                         I'm of Japanese ancestry you assume 
                         I know karate. Have I ever led you to
