               a tiny green speck. The crew step closer to get a better look.

                         tiny micro-droids? Can't you just shrink 
                         us?

                         tiny atoms. And have you priced those 
                         lately? I'm not made of money - leave

                         an intestinal spasm, expelling - among

               [He assembles the holophonoer and begins to play. The holophonor 
               sounds a bit like a violin. A flare of blue-green light comes 
               out of the end of the holophonor and swirls around above Fry 
               and Leela's heads. The spiral opens out into an image of a formally 
               dressed Fry and Leela dancing on the rings of a planet. They 
               dance and the planet flies away into the distance. The image 
               fades to the night sky of a planet. The clouds in the sky merge 
               into outlines of Fry and Leela. The outlines kiss and a flash 
               radiates from their lips. The holophonor has changed to an undersea 
               setting. Two seals that look like Fry and Leela swim around with 
               each other. They swim to the top of the sea and leap into the 
               air beneath the full moon in the sky. A wave sweeps past the 
               moon and spills onto the shoreline. On the beach a clam shell 
               opens and in it's pearl the formally dressed Fry and Leela dance 
               some more. Fry lifts Leela into the air and the pearl flashes 
               into hundreds of white sparks that fall around the mesmerised 
               Leela's head. Fry's sonnet ends and Leela is speechless. She 
               takes Fry's hand and walks with him into the bedroom.]

                         that's where you're gonna be living!
 
                         
               
               [He holds his sword back over his shoulder, ready to cut the 
               medulla oblongata. The Worm Mayor stares in disbelief. Fry pulls 
               back his sword and the Worm Mayor gives in.]
 
               
                                     WORM MAYOR
                         Stop! We'll leave.  But one day you'll 
                         be eating a fast-food burger and boom! 
                         You'll be crawling with us again! Ever 
                         wonder what makes special sauce so special? 
                         Yo!
 
               
               [He points at himself. He gestures to the worms and they leave.]
 
               
               
               [Leela's Bedroom. Leela is fast asleep on her bed. She is wearing 
               sexy, near see-through underwear. On her face is an open book 
               called True Stories Of Courageous Animals. She snores loudly. 
               Enter Fry. She awakens.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Fry? I missed you. Did you find out 
                         what you needed to find out?
 
               
                                     FRY
                         I'm about to.  Leela, let me play for 
                         you one for time.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         You don't have to do that. I'm still 
                         seduced from before.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Please, it's important to me.

               
               [He plays. Rather than the soothing, romantic music that played 
               earlier in the day, Fry now plays creepy, unromantic music. The 
               swirls come from the end of the holophoner and the head of Frankenstein's 
               monster appears. He groans and screams then disappears.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         What's that supposed to mean?

               
                                     FRY
                         I don't know. I got nervous and started 
                         thinking about neck bolts.  Wow! Did 
                         you see that vase break? It was all 
                         like -
 
               
               [He makes smashy sounds. Horrified, Leela pulls the blanket around 
               herself.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         What's happened to you?

               
                                     FRY
                         Nothing. I got rid of the worms.

               
                                     LEELA
                         What? Why would you do that?

               
                                     FRY
                         Leela, I had worms. I needed to know 
                         who you loved. Me or them.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Well...which of you wrote me that sonnet?
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         I did. I think. It was probably about 
                         50/50. But that's how I really felt 
                         about you, I swear!
 
               
               [He reaches out to Leela but she moves back and sighs.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         I don't know.

               
                                     FRY
                         Please. Give me a chance to be romantic 
                         on my own. I've got a baggy of massage 
                         oil, and I'm gonna give you my super 
                         back rub, just like a I used to give 
                         Amy when I was going out with her, and 
                         she always seemed... - Uh-oh!
 
               
               [She angrily holds out his holophonor to him.]

               
               [Robot Arms Apartments: Fry and Bender's Apartment. Bender stands 
               in the doorway of Fry's room wearing pyjama bottoms. Fry sighs.]
 
               
               
                                     BENDER
                         Sorry you struck out sausage link. If 
                         it's any consolation, my life is great! 
                         Babes! Bucks! I got it all!
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Well, at least I learned Leela's a lost 
                         cause. I give up.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         There you go!  Goodnight. I gotta get 
                         up early to go parasailing with movie 
                         stars!
 
               
               [The door closes. Fry picks up a book called My First Holophonor 
               and leans it up on a chair. He pulls the chair towards him and 
               plays his holophonor. Smooth harmonic music comes from the holophonor. 
               The holophonor swirls form a pink ball in the air. A smile trickles 
               around the ball. A single eye opens in the middle of it and some 
               purple hair held up in a ponytail appears on top. Fry smiles 
               at the image of his love and continues playing.]
