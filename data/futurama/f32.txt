                         on how this is your own fault for being 
                         such an idiot. But when a robotic Nixon 
                         is on the loose, we have a duty to take 
                         action. Idiot.

                         Not so fast, Nixon! Are you familiar 
                         with audio tape?

                         Uh-oh. I don't like where this is heading.

                          And I'll go into people's houses at 
                         night and wreck up the place!

                         My God? I really sound like that? I 
                         thought my voice had more of a Clark 
                         Gable quality.

                         The jig's up, Nixon. We'll trade you 
                         the tape for the body.

                         again. Except I can't get these damn
