                         getting one of my Hawaiian shirts toned 
                         down, so I thought I'd drop in for your

                         Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have 
                         to think about it.

                         Yeah. You know, it's times like this 
                         I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight, 
                         you princes of Maine, you kings of New

                         Officer, would it be alright if we adopted 
                         one of the kids?
 
               
                                     SMITTY
                         Might as well. They're just gonna rot 
                         in the evidence locker.

                         up a good point. She does have an ear 
                         on her face.

                         but she still deserves a good home.

                         Oh, alright. If you really want that 
                         one, I can give her an operation to 
                         make her acceptable.

                         to be different. And I just wished I'd 
                         realised that when I was her age.
