                         I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled

                         It's a gigantic diamond! That thing 
                         must be worth a fortune.

                         Y'know, if you still want your land, 
                         we could just trade back for it.
 
               
                                     SINGING WIND
                         Hmm. We always thought bead was worthless. 
                         We assumed our ancestors were cheated 
                         because they not have concept of ownership.

                         So we can have the diamond?

               
                                     SINGING WIND
                         No. We do have concept of ownership. 
                         You are free to go. Sorry about all 
                         the rustling and kidnapping.

                         this planet. It's a dump. We'll buy 
                         new planet and act like it's sacred. 
                         With cash like this, who's going to 
                         argue? Nobody, that's who!

                         Martians.
