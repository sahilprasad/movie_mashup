                         Yeah! Hey, later, you wanna drive out 
                         to Europa? We could have a picnic and 
                         spit watermelon seeds at Jupiter.

                         in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how 
                         we sort of think exactly alike, and 
                         junk.

                         out with you.

                         of a sudden, she's talking about hanging 
                         out. Hangin out? She's getting way too 
                         serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela.

                         us, I can't be alone with her.

                         chocolate but then you start to get 
                         tired of it because it always wants 
                         to hang out with you?

                         But I think we're spending too much 
                         time together.
 
               
                                     AMY
                         You're breaking up with me?

               
                                     FRY
                         I just think we should start seeing 
                         other people.
 
               
                                     AMY
                         But, I was really having fun.  If that's 
                         how you feel.

                         Well, whatever. Hey, listen, as long 
                         as we're not seeing each other, you 
                         mind if I ask someone else out for Valentine's 
                         Day?

                         bad, being a third wheel.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Hey, I can get a date too. Now that 
                         I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of 
                         women!

                         attract one sort of woman.

               [Fry and Petunia don't seem to be gelling.]

                         So tell me about your prospects. You 
                         a good gambler?
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Well, ma'am I--

               
                                     PETUNIA
                         What's your game? Bingo? Keno? Wait 
                         a minute! You don't have your own body.
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         No, but I control this arm.

               
                                     PETUNIA
                         Slots player, huh? Sorry, but I think 
                         I can do better.
 
               
               [She gets up from the table.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Wait, come back, uh, darling.

               
                                     PETUNIA
                         Can't, hon. I gotta catch my bus back 
                         to Nutley. I'd kiss you goodnight but 
                         I lost my teeth pulling out a stump.
 
                         
               
               [She walks towards the exit.]

                         So anyways, Leela, I'd love to take 
                         a whack at ya but that 10:15 to Nutley 
                         ain't goin' nowheres without yours truly 
                         behinds the wheel.
 
               
                                     PETUNIA
                         Excuse me, did you say "10:15 to Nutley"?
 
                         
               
                                     SAL
                         Why, yes I dids.

               
               [They stare into each others eyes and passionately kiss. Leela 
               turns to Bender.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         (whispering) Bender! Did you just round 
                         up our dates at the bus station?
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Of course not.

               
                                     SAL
                         Anybodys else for Nutley?

               
               [Bender's customers get up and head for the door. Zapp's date 
               also leaves.]
 
               
                                     ZAPP
                         Baby, wait! You didn't show me your 
                         surprise.
 
               
               [Gary has his arm around Amy.]

               
                                     GARY
                         (whispering) You know what I'd like 
                         to do...?
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Oh, jeez, get a room!

               
                                     GARY
                         Maybe later.

               
               [Fry is shocked.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Hey, I have an idea: Let's all go out 
                         for ice cream.
 
               
                                     GARY
                         Actually, I thought Amy might like to 
                         come back to my place for coffee.
 
                         
               
                                     AMY
                         I don't really like coffee.

               
                                     GARY
                         Neither do I.

               
               [Fry is shocked again.]

               
                                     AMY
                         Ooh, I feel a little tipsy!

               
               [Fry is shocked again.]

               
                                     GARY
                         Let me pick up the check.

               
                                     FRY
                         Nooo!  That's it I'm gettin' the hell 
                         outta here.  Ooh! Ow!
 
               
               [Leela hears Fry and walks to their table just as Amy and Gary 
               are about to leave.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Why, if it isn't my favourite head on 
                         Amy's body: Fry.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Oh, Leela!

               
                                     AMY
                         We were just on our way out.

               
                                     LEELA
                         Nonsense, the evening's young. So, Gary, 
                         what do you do for a living?
 
               
                                     GARY
                         I'm a banking industry regulator.

               
               [Amy sighs.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         Really? Y'know I heard that banking 
                         industry regulations are really very 
                         simple.
 
               
                                     GARY
                         Oh, no, that's not true. You see, modern 
                         banking regulations are a product of 
                         five different regulatory traditions. 
                         Six if you wanna get technical.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Oh, I do.

                         It all began in 1410 when a number of 
                         noblemen convened...
 
               
               [Fry and Leela look at each other.]

               
                                     FRY (WHISPERING)
                         Thank you.

               
               [They smile.]

                         There you are, good as new. Except for 
                         your dorsal fin, I'm afraid I couldn't 
                         find it after the crash.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Can I live without it?

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         If you call that living.

                         I still don't understand why you wouldn't 
                         let me graft a laser cannon onto your 
                         chest. To crush those who disobey you. 
                          But I guess we're just two different 
                         people.
 
               
               [He and Zoidberg leave.]

                         So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And 
                         I hope there are no hard feelings about 
                         your date, or stuff.
 
               
                                     AMY
                         It's OK, I had fun. And if I ever feel 
                         lonely I can just look over at this 
                         disfiguring scar and think of you.
 
                         
               
               [They smile. Amy leaves. Fry sighs.]

                         Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own 
                         body back.
 
               
               [He yawns, stretches and pats his chest. He looks down and sighs.

                         hooked up OK?

                         Seems to be. My neck's just a little 
                         tender.  Ow! Cool!  Ow! Listen, Leela. 
                         Thanks for rescuing me last night.

                         Anytime. I actually enjoyed hanging 
                         out with you.

                         Yep, everything worked out great thanks 
                         to good old Bender.

                         Come on! It's not like you intentionally 
                         set us up with bad dates so we'd spend 
                         Valentine's Day together.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?

                         No! You didn't! You just corralled a 
                         bunch of stiffs at the bus station and 
                         pocketed our money!
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         True. But in the end, isn't that what 
                         Valentine's Day is really all about?

                                     FRY
                         I guess so.  Watch the neck! Watch the 
                         neck!
