                         and drinking on TV really make me cool? 
                         Of course they do.  How 'bout committing 
                         crimes and violence? Again, the answer 
                         is "yes." But do we really want our 
                         kids exposed to that kind of trash on 
                         TV? I say absolutely not!  Uh...on the 
                         other hand, most - perhaps all the blame 
                         rests with the parents. That's right

                         Have you ever tried simply turning off 
                         the TV, sitting down with your children,
