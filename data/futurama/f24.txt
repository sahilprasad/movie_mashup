                         Good news, everyone. Tomorrow you'll 
                         be making a delivery to Ebola 9, the 
                         virus planet.

                         Because tonight's a special night and 
                         I want all of you to be alive. It's 
                         the Academy of Inventors annual symposium.

                         Wow! I love symposia.

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         It's the event of the scientific season. 
                         Every member presents an invention and 
                         the best one wins the Academy prize.

                         Sounds boring.

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Oh, my, yes. But not this year, because 
                         my latest invention is unbeatable. Behold! 
                         The death clock.  Simply jam your finger 
                         in the hole and this readout tells you 
                         exactly how long you have left to live.

                         Does it really work?

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Well it's occasionally off by a few 
                         seconds. What with free will and all.

                         Sounds like fun. How long do I have 
                         left to live?
 
               
               [He puts his finger in the hole and the clock dings.]

                         I'm the Academy's oldest living member, 
                         you know. These youngsters all look 
                         up to me.

                         show his wrinkled face.
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Why don't you just leave me alone, Wernstrom?!

                         hill. It's time to leave science to 
                         the 120-year-olds.
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         You young turks think you know everything. 
                         I was inventing things when you were 
                         barely turning senile.

                         going to take a nap before the ceremonies.

                         student at Mars University. But then 
                         after one fateful pop-quiz...

                         later and still no revenge. I'm essentially 
                         in the clear.

                         Annual Symposium, I'm your host, Ron

                         the spray-on toupee and - of course 
                         - the technology to keep human heads 
                         alive in jars.  But wait, there's more. 
                         We've got a whole line-up of inventors 
                         tonight, starting with that up and coming 
                         young star, Ogden Wernstrom.

                         Distinguished members of the Academy, 
                         I present to you, the Reverse SCUBA 
                         Suit. Observe!  Fetch!  Now, sit!  I 
                         said sit!  Bad fish!

                         death clock you presented last year.

                         new in the next ten minutes. Perhaps 
                         some sort of death clock.

                         Now, we all know telescopes allow us 
                         to see distant objects. But what if 
                         we want to smell distant objects? Well 
                         now we can! Thanks to my new invention...the 
                         Smellescope.

                         here, around the olive pit and into 
                         this cigar burn. And this appears to 
                         be a, doodle of myself as a cowboy. 
                          But the Smellescope is brilliant, I 
                         tell you! Think of the astronomical 
                         odours you'll smell thanks to me.  Oh,

                         I've waited a hundred years for this, 
                         Farnsworth. I give your invention the 
                         worst grade imaginable: An A-minus-minus.

                         And now for the presentation of the 
                         award. Listen, folks, I'm practically 
                         giving this prize away to Dr. Wernstrom, 
                         for his fish thingy.

               outside, sighs and walks away.]

                         Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a

                         No, Professor, don't give up. There 
                         were plenty of times in my century when 
                         I was gonna give up but I never did. 
                         Never! Hey, are you even listening to 
                         me? Oh, I give up!

                         By God, you're right! I'm going to build 
                         that Smellescope!

                                     FARNSWORTH
                         No, I remembered that I'd built one 
                         last year. Go ahead. Try it. You'll 
                         find that every heavenly body has its 
                         own particular scent. Here, I'll point 
                         it at Jupiter.

                         Smells like strawberries.

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Exactly! And now Saturn.

                         Uranus.

                         I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed 
                         Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke 
                         once and for all.
 
               
                                     FRY

                         you.

                         No, no, I think I'll just smell around 
                         a bit over here!  Hmm.  Hmm.

                         A stench so foul is right off the funk-o-meter. 
                         I dare say Fry may have discovered the 
                         smelliest object in the known universe.

                         Hmm, perhaps the computer can calculate 
                         its trajectory.  My God! Whatever it 
                         is it's headed straight for us. With 
                         enough force to reduce this entire city

                         Ah! Just as I thought. The answer lies 
                         in this movie I found on the Internet.

                          New York City: the year 2000. The most 
                         wasteful society in the history of the 
                         galaxy and it was running out of places 
                         to empty its never-ending output of 
                         garbage.  The landfills were full. New 
                         Jersey was full. And so, under cover 
                         of darkness, the city put its garbage 
                         out to sea on the world's largest barge. 
                          The repulsive barge circled the oceans 
                         for 50 years but no country would accept 
                         it. Not even that really filthy one. 
                         You know the one I mean. Finally, in 
                         2052, the city used its mob connections 
                         to obtain a rocket and launch the garbage 
                         into outer space. Some experts claim 
                         the ball might return to Earth someday, 
                         but their concerns were dismissed as 
                         "depressing".

                         out more than my share of that trash 
                         up there. Also, one month my toilet 
                         broke and it just went straight in the 
                         garbage can.  Leela was right. The people 
                         of the 20th century were idiotic slobs.
