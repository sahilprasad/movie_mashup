                         forever through the void as gravity's 
                         plaything. Oh cruel fate, to be thusly

                         It bones for thee. The only thing that 
                         keeps me sane is the thought that I

                         no! An asteroid field. If even a pea

                         a monestary high in the Himalayas. I'll 
                         need a long sleeved coat.

                         Actually we only practice martial arts 
                         as a form of meditation. We are a strictly 
                         non-violent sect.

                         Oh. Then get in the laundry room or 
                         I'll kick your butts!
 
               
               [They file into the laundry room.]

                         This is the worst crazy sect I've ever 
                         been in.
 
               
               [Fry slams the door behind them.]

               
               [Bender talks to God.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         So, do you know what I'm gonna do before 
                         I do it?
 
               
                                     GOD
                         Yes.

               
                                     BENDER
                         What if I do something different?

               
                                     GOD
                         Then I don't know that.

               
                                     BENDER
                         Cool cool! I bet a lot of people pray 
                         to you huh?
 
               
                                     GOD
                         Yes, but there are so many asking so 
                         much. After a while you just sorta tune 
                         it out.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Y'know, I was God once.

               
                                     GOD
                         Yes I saw. You were doing well until 
                         everyone died.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         It was awful. I tried helping them. 
                         I tried not helping them but in the 
                         end I couldn't do them any good. Do 
                         you think what I did was wrong?
 
               
                                     GOD
                         Right and wrong are just words. What 
                         matters is what you do.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Yeah I know, that's why I asked if what 
                         I did - forget it.
 
               
                                     GOD
                         Bender, being God isn't easy, if you 
                         do too much, people get dependent. And 
                         if you do nothing, they lose hope. You 
                         have to use a light touch, like a safecracker 
                         or a pickpocket.

                         Or a guy who burns down the bar for 
                         the insurance money.
 
               
                                     GOD
                         Yes, if you make it look like an electrical 
                         thing. When you do things right, people 
                         won't be sure you've done anything at 
                         all.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Does that mean you wouldn't send me 
                         back to Earth even if I prayed to you?
 
                         
               
                                     GOD
                         Earth? Which way is that?

               
               [Bender looks around.]

                         (sadly) I don't know.

                         Fry, it's been three days. And even 
                         if you stay here the rest of your life, 
                         there is virtually no chance of finding 
                         him. It's time to give up.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         (sadly) You're right. I'm never gonna 
                         see him again. I know he was evil and 
                         on more than one occasion he, he actually 
                         stole my blood.  But still, I wish I 
                         had Bender back.

                         Huh?

               
               [Bender wakes up.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         Huh? Wha? You say something?

               
                                     GOD
                         No, no. Well so long. Remember what 
                         we talked about.

                         This is by a wide margin the least likely 
                         thing that has ever happened.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Guys, you'll never believe what happened. 
                         First I was God then I met God!

                         We climbed a mountain and locked up 
                         some monks.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Oh no the monks. We forgot to let them 
                         out of the laundry room.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Do we have to? I mean they're monks. 
                         I'm sure their God will let them out 
                         or at least give them more shoes to 
                         eat.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Fat chance. You can't count on God for 
                         jack. He pretty much told me so himself. 
                         Now come on. If we don't save those 
                         monks no one will!
