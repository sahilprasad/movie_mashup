                         Good news everyone, the university is 
                         bringing me up on disciplinary charges! 
                         Wait, that's not good news at all.

                         Whatever you did Professor, I'm sure 
                         there's a reasonable explanation.

                         always in favour of saving Hitler's

                         suddenly you've gone too far.

                         Farnsworth is old, but if you consider 
                         his age he's likely to die soon!  Hey

                         Professor Farnsworth, I thought "Why 
                         should I?" Then later Leela made the 
                         film. But if I had made the film, you

                         by removing some skin cells from one

                         That's impossible. You can't go faster 
                         than the speed of light.

                         increased the speed of light in 2208.

                         Nothing is impossible. I understand 
                         how the engines work now. It came to 
                         me in a dream.  The engines don't move 
                         the ship at all. The ship stays where 
                         it is and the engines move the universe 
                         around it.

                         That's a complete load.

                         Nothing's a complete load. Not if you 
                         can imagine it. That's what being a 
                         scientist is all about. Right Professor?

               [Cut to: Near-Death Star Landing Pad. The ship's engines power 
               up and they begin to move the universe in a flow-mo sequence 
               lifted from The Matrix. The ship flies away, it's exhaust blasting 
               the guardbots away. Near-Death Star defenses fire on the ship 
               and repeatedly miss as it makes its getaway.]

                         I'm as spry as a 140 year old.  See? 
                         I only broke one ankle.

                         So what were they doing to you in that 
                         awful drawer?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Oh, they had me hooked up to a bizarre 
                         virtual world that seemed absolutely 
                         real.

                         It was as though I was living in a facility 
                         in Florida with hundreds of other old 
                         people. All day long we'd play bingo, 
                         eat oatmeal and wait for our children 
                         to call.

                         It's a hundred times more horrible than 
                         anything I could imagine.
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Oh my yes. Thank you all for saving 
                         me. Especially you my little clone. 
                         No matter what you decide to do with 
                         your life, I'm still proud of you.

                         I've already decided. Dad, when I grow 
                         up I wanna be just like you.

                         Don't worry son. You will. Incidentally, 
                         you might want to read up on a condition 
                         known as "wandering bladder."
