                         me. I'm even dating a young Brazilian

                         I say she's robbing the grave.

                         with a tale of bedroom antics, the likes

                         I got Bender-related news. I'm in love 
                         and I'm taking all my friends out to 
                         celebrate.

                         try the pasta. It's got a real nice 
                         profit margin. Bam! So, special occasion 
                         tonight?

                         of yours.

                         I intend to. Through the lost art of 
                         the toast.  To Angleyne, she's got it 
                         all. Looks, charm and the love of a 
                         fabulous bending robot.

                         of legs that don't quit unexpectedly 
                         and that jerk Flexo steals her away? 
                         It's time to kick some shiny, metal 
                         ass.  You degenerate hussy! I'm disappointed 
                         in you too, Angleyne.

                         by is your choice of wine. Really, it's 
                         the steward's fault.

                         this.

                         lean back and enjoy life.

                         to be Flexo, arrange a date, show up 
                         disguised as him and catch her two-timing

                         when I divorced you.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         But going through a divorce together, 
                         you can't tell me that didn't bring 
                         us closer. Care to dance?
 
               
                                     ANGLEYNE
                         You know I love dancing but you always 
                         hated it.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         In that case it's something I've always 
                         wanted to make up to you.  Hey, scratchmo. 
                         How 'bout dropping me and the lady some 
                         rump-rattling beats?
 
               
               [He takes out his cash and throws it at the DJbot. The Mafiabots 
               watch.]

                         I had hoped that by the second time 
                         he flashed his cash my rage would have 
                         subsided. Sadly that has not happened.

                         You used to be so inflexible, Flexo. 
                         You have really loosened up!

               [He grabs Angleyne and tilts her back and she laughs.]

                         Flexo!

               
               [The robots dancing on the platforms start to fall apart and

                         So the moral of the story is: If you 
                         want it to stay sunk, tie a weight to 
                         it!

                         feel like a million volts.

                         eh? I'd better seduce her a little more, 
                         just to be sure.
 
               
                                     ANGLEYNE
                         Well, it's late. I should get home to 
                         my trailer.

                         made me realise I love Flexo.
 
               
               [She hugs Flexo and cries.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         But ... but ...  I love you so much, 
                         Angleyne, I want you to be happy no 
                         matter what.
 
               
                                     ANGLEYNE
                         What, what are you saying?

               
                                     BENDER
                         I'm saying I've got an unbendable girder 
                         to bend.
 
               
                                     ANGLEYNE
                         You can't bend that girder. It's unbendable!
 
                         
               
                                     BENDER
                         Well I don't know anything about lifting, 
                         so that just leaves us the one option.
 
                         
               
               [He grunts as he tries to bend the girder. He stops and takes 
               some BENDGAY out of his chest cabinet. He rubs it on his hands 
               and arms and tries bending again. Oil dribbles down his forehead, 
               his door pops off and his antenna explodes but he finally manages 
               to bend the girder away from Flexo's head. Flexo waddles out 
               from under it and shakes Bender's hand.]
 
               
                                     FLEXO
                         Thanks, buddy. Another year under that 
                         and I'd have been a goner.
 
               
               [Angleyne hugs Bender.]

               
                                     ANGLEYNE
                         I'll always remember this, Bender.
 
                         
               
               [She hugs Flexo and Bender wipes a tear away from his eye.]
 
               
               
                                     BENDER
                         (crying) Me too. Me too. (talking) Jerk.
 
                         
               
               [Planet Express: Lounge. The staff sit around the table.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         So Flexo and Angleyne had sex right 
                         there on the factory floor? Well, at 
                         least you got bending out of your system.
 
                         
               
                                     BENDER
                         Yes. I won't be up to bending again 
                         for a long, long time.
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Perhaps it's your outlook that needs 
                         a good bend. A 90-degree bend to a place 
                         where happiness is perpendicular to 
                         wonderment.

                         Professor, we're all sick of your upbeat 
                         attitude.
 
               
                                     AMY
                         I'll say.

                         Nonsense. It's just like in the song 
                         I wrote:
 
               (singing) We all need a new angle on life,

               You gotta bend away all your trouble and your strife,

               
               [Leela sighs.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         Bender, you've gotta help us.

               
                                     BENDER
                         I try to get out but they keep pulling 
                         me back in.
 
               
               [He stands up and rolls up his sleeves.]

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         (singing) You gotta dangle,

               Have a new angle,

               Wangle a new dangle on life.

               
               [Bender bends him and he screams. He has bent right over backwards.]
 
               
               
                                     AMY
                         No, Bender! The other way.

               
                                     BENDER
                         I like him better this way.

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         I'm sad now.

               
                                     LEELA
                         Eh, it's fine.
