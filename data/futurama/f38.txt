                         won! I'm the greatest!

                         win a video game. Now lets concentrate

                         Hey everyone jam a sock in your spit 
                         faucets.  Not long ago I spent my lonely 
                         nights renting slash flicks with Rat 
                         Man and his girlfriend. But then a beautiful 
                         woman arrived and - stop eating pig! 
                         And she brought new hope for me and 
                         our once great civilisation. Now a million 
                         centuries of Cyclops destiny depend 
                         on the answer to one question......Leela, 
                         will you marry me?

                         Well, this is the real me. But I can 
                         explain. We all have needs. Mine was 
                         to make it with five weirdos and have 
                         them scrub my five castles. I gave you 
                         all what you wanted and of course I 
                         made a few bucks letting Pig watch through 
                         the two way mirror. Can any of you sa 
                         you wouldn't have done the exact same 
                         thing in my position?

                         He's a saint!

               
                                     LEELA
                         But why did you have all five weddings 
                         on the same day?
 
               
                                     ALKAZAR
                         Hey lady, you got any idea how much 
                         it costs to rent a tux that changes 
                         shape?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Alright Alkazar, I just have one last 
                         question for you.
 
               
                                     ALKAZAR
                         What's that?

               
                                     LEELA
                         If you can change form, why didn't you 
                         change it in the one place that counts?
 
                         
               
               [Everyone cheers and hoots.]

               at the controls. Bender admires his sack of loot. Leela sits 
               on the arm of the couch with Fry and Farnsworth.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Thanks for saving me from that creep 
                         Fry.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Hey, that's what I do.

               
                                     LEELA
                         I guess I was so desperate to find out 
                         who I really was, I forgot who I really 
                         was.
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         No harm done. In the many decades you'll 
                         work to repay me for that shipment of 
                         popcorn you destroyed, you'll have plenty 
                         of time to search for your true home.

                                     LEELA
                         Yeah. I mean, how many planets can there 
                         be?
