                         Good news, everyone! I've invented a 
                         device that allows you to operate equipment 
                         from great distances. I call it "the 
                         fing-longer".  Observe.  And, here we 
                         go.  There!

                         Yeah, it's really long. But what did 
                         you just turn on with it?

                         I invented. You pose it a What-If question 
                         and it generates a video simulation 
                         of what would happen.

                         or nude beaches. So I've always secretly 
                         wondered: What if I was 500-feet tall?

                         So that's what things would be like
