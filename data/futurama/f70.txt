                         Now I'm more interested in that new 
                         pizza parlour across the street. Kinda 
                         makes me pine for my days as a pizza 
                         delivery boy. "Here's you pizza," I'd 
                         say. "I didn't order any," they'd say. 
                         And then I'd be off to my next adventure.

                         Look, I don't wanna be in this exhibit. 
                         That's why I need your help - so I can 
                         be one tiny iota less pathetic than 
                         you.

                         Tiny Iota, that guy was great! But I'll 
                         teach you everything I know.

                         OK, let's see what you can do.

                         One thing she can do is lodge a ball 
                         in the depth centre of your brain. You 
                         better get a batting helmet.
 
               
               [Aaron takes Bender's head off and uses it as a helmet. He lifts 
               Bender's teeth so he can see.]

                         (quietly) Alright, low and away!

               
               [She throws the ball and knocks Aaron down. Bender picks his 
               head up and staggers around disorientated.]

                         OK try it again but this time keep your 
                         eye off the ball.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         You mean "keep your eye on the ball"?

                         hall of fame?

                         bat upside down.
 
               
                                     AARON JR
                         Just pitch the ball.

               
                                     LEELA
                         OK, eye off the ball.

               
               [She throws the ball without looking at it, Aaron swings, misses 
               and Fry catches the ball.]

                         Hooray!

               
                                     AARON JR
                         You did it Leela!

               
                                     LEELA
                         I didn't hit the batter! For once I 
                         was pitching and not just belly-itching!

                         a rash goin' around.

                         You only go in as a joke when we're

               looking Bender chuckles and steals some drinks from the people 
               in front of him. Amy takes one too.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Pitch. The now free ball flies through the air and into 
               a target marked Hit It Here And Win The Game. The target lights 
               up, a bell rings, Jackie runs around the pitch, the giant rats 
               run out and the Slurm blimp crashes.]

                         A grand slam blern. The Mets lose, their 
                         season is over! And no question, Leela 
                         - the first woman ever to reach the 
                         majors will go down as the single worst 
                         player in the history of blernsball...!
 
                         
               
               [Cut to: Pitch. Leela walks sadly to the bench. Jackie jumps 
               around with joy and the Boston players lift her up.]

                         (voice-over) ...And yet tonight we have 
                         witnessed the beginning of a great career 
                         for the first woman to play the sport 
                         well - Jackie Anderson!
 
               
               [Cut to: Tunnel. Leela walks away from the celebrations hanging 
               her head in shame. Jackie pokes her head around the end of the 
               tunnel.]

                         Leela?

               
               [Leela turns around.]

                         Jackie. I guess you were right, I'm 
                         a lousy role model. I'm sorry.
 
               
                                     JACKIE
                         No, don't be. It turns out you were 
                         an inspiration afterall.

                         Uh-huh. You were so awful that women 
                         everywhere set out to prove that they 
                         don't stink as bad as you. You know, 
                         like a pig or something.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Oh, that's so kind of you. I guess I 
                         made a difference afterall!
 
               
                                     JACKIE
                         You absolutely did Leela. Now please, 
                         please retire! Immediately!

               over.]

               Jr looks at a cardboard stand-up of Leela, standing where he 
               used to sit. He sighs.]

                         football player of all time.
 
               
                                     AARON JR
                         Yeah. Yeah.
