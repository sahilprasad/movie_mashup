                         Gracias.  Single Female Lawyer, where 
                         were you on the night of August 23rd?

                         else here. You only wrote two pages 
                         of dialogue.

                         Well, it took an hour to write. I thought 
                         it would take an hour to read.

                         as a single female lawyer, and so shall

                         were out living their lives, I wasted 
                         mine watching TV, because deep down 
                         I knew it might one day help me save 
                         the world. Plus, I would have lost my 
                         Workman's Comp if I hadd gone outside.
