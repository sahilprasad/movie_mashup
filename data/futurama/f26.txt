                                     COUNTESS
                         By God, you're right! I'm a class-3 
                         yacht.
 
               
               [A propellor comes out from under her. Bender hops on and they 
               rise to the surface.]
 
               
               [Titanic Deck. Passengers are boarding the escape pods.]

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Thank God there are plenty of escape 
                         pods; We won't have to dress up like 
                         women and children.
 
               
               [He takes his hat off and throws his lolly down. He and the others 
               run into the escape pod. Leela and Fry stop outside.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         We can't leave yet. We've got to wait 
                         for Bender. The high gravity must be 
                         slowing down his looting.
 
               
               [Amy's parents walk out onto the deck.]

               
                                     MRS WONG
                         Amy!

               
                                     AMY
                         Mom? Dad? You're alive!

               
                                     MR WONG
                         Yeah but so what? The important thing 
                         is we found you a new man.
 
               
                                     MRS WONG
                         A captain.

               
                                     AMY
                         Uh, Mom, I don't--  Hi!

               
                                     KIF
                         (sexfully) Hello!

               
               [Kif picks Amy up and carries her to the escape pod. They kiss.]
 
               
               
               [Cut to: Escape Pod. The ship begins to twist and distort.]
 
               
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         I don't feel well!

               
               [His head twists around like a squishy goo.]

               
               [Cut to: Titanic Deck. Fry points at something in space.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see 
                         it I'll think back to that moment when 
                         we almost--  Never mind!
 
               
               [Hermes pokes his head out of the escape pod.]

               
                                     HERMES
                         Everyone else is off the ship. Where 
                         in Babylon is Bender?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         I don't know. But we can't wait any 
                         longer.
 
               
               [She gets into the pod and Fry follows. He looks back at the 
               ship.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Goodbye, Bender.

               
               [He closes the hatch. Bender and the Countess run out of the 
               ship panting.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         (shouting) Wait for us!

               
               [The escape pod lifts off and the airlock between it and the 
               Titanic deck seals. Bender and the Countess leap from the deck, 
               smashing through the glass airlock.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Outside Escape Pod. Bender and the Countess float towards 
               the pod and Bender reaches out his hand.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Escape pod. It rocks as Bender grabs hold. Everyone 
               is sat along the length of the pod and Leela steers.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Something's wrong. We're two metric 
                         tons overweight.
 
               
                                     AMY
                         Well, its not me!

               
               [Fry looks out of the airlock window.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Look!

               
               [Everyone looks out the window to see Bender and the Countess.
 
               
               
               [Cut to: Outside Escape Pod. The Titanic creaks and is sucked 
               into the black hole. The escape pod starts to drift back towards 
               it.]
 
               
                                     COUNTESS
                         I'm slipping, Bender. The pull is too 
                         strong!
 
               
               [She slips from Bender's grasp but he grabs on to her bracelet. 
               It's all that holds them together. She screams.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         I can't live without you. If you let 
                         go, I let go!
 
               
                                     COUNTESS
                         No! You have too much to live for. It 
                         may hurt for a while but one day you'll 
                         share your love again. After all, it's 
                         shareware.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Don't talk like that. Tragic romances 
                         always have a happy ending.
 
               
               [The bracelet snaps and the Countess falls towards the black 
               hole.]
 
               
                                     COUNTESS
                         (shouting) Farewell!

               
               [The black hole sucks her in.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         Nooo!

               
               [Cut to: Escape Pod. Bender walks in and closes the airlock behind 
               him.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         She's gone.

               
                                     LEELA
                         But she saved all our lives. Without 
                         her, we're light enough to get away.
 
                         
               
               [Bender slams his head against the airlock and cries.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows 
                         what happens in a black hole. It's possible 
                         she's still alive in another dimension 
                         somewhere. Right, Professor?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Oh, yes, absolutely!  Not a chance!
 
                         
               
               [He draws his finger across his neck and mimes being hung.]
 
               
               
                                     BENDER
                         At least I'll always have her bracelet! 
                          What do you think it's worth?
 
               
               [Hermes takes a look at it.]

               
                                     HERMES
                         It's fake, mon!

               
               [Bender cries as the the pod flies away into space.]
