                         I don't get it, Michelle. The last time 
                         I saw you, you were doing great. You 
                         had just dumped me and you were well 
                         on your way to getting you life back 
                         on track. Why'd you freeze yourself?

                         Oh, Fry. After you left, things took 
                         a turn for the worse. I got married.

                         (voice-over) His name was Charles. He 
                         attended a law school so prestigious, 
                         the basketball team was coached by Ruth 
                         Bader Ginsberg.  I put him through law 
                         school by working as a dog walker for 
                         antisocial dogs.

                         (voice-over) Desperately depressed, 
                         I turned to the one thing that could 
                         lessen my pain: A carnival. Unfortunately, 
                         a corn dog bone got lodged in the control 
                         panel of the Spizzler, and I had to 
                         ride it for eight hours.

                         (voice-over) But it did give me a chance 
                         to think...

                         ...and I remembered the last time I 
                         was truly happy; When I was with you.

                         Aww. So you froze yourself to come look 
                         for me?
 
               
                                     MICHELLE
                         No, I did it to get a fresh start. I 
                         didn't know what had happened to you 
                         - no one did. The police were going 
                         to conduct a search but your parents 
                         felt it was a waste of taxpayer money.

                         That's the same reason they kept me 
                         out of school. So, no one even cared 
                         that I was gone?

                         stay with her all the time.

                         just having a hard time adjusting to

                          I feel so out of place here. I don't

                         in your time.

                         well.

                         love a woman. But this seems like a

                         matters but our love.

               Two urban defence vehicles drive either side of them and start 
               shooting at each other. They flip over and Fry and Butch dodge 
               them. Fry rolls down the opposite lane, straight towards an oncoming 
               car. He lifts his skateboard onto the other side, missing the 
               car. Butch holds onto the bumper of a car and Fry grabs the bumper 
               of another one. He coughs as he gets exhaust in his face. The 
               cars split and Fry and Butch fly towards a lamppost. The bandana 
               wraps around it and their heads hit each other. The kids and 
               Michelle gather around.]

                         It's cool. Back off.  (crying) My knee. 
                         I scraped it.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Aww. Poor little guy. Let me just take 
                         a look at - aha!  I won! I'm the new 
                         chief! I'm the tallest and I weigh the 
                         most!
 
               
               [The kids takes their guns out.]

               
                                     BUTCH
                         Hand it over, you giant idiot.

               
               [An armoured car pulls up and honks its horn.]

               
                                     BUTCH'S GIRLFRIEND
                         Hey, Butch, your mom's here.

               
                                     BUTCH
                         Aw, man.

               
                                     BUTCH'S MOM
                         Come on, kids. You're late for Hebrew 
                         school.
 
               
               [The kids groan and drop their guns.]

               
                                     OROWHEAT
                         I don't wanna go.

               
                                     BUTCH'S GIRLFRIEND
                         Every Monday and Wednesday's the same 
                         thing.
 
               
               [They get into the car and drive away.]

               
                                     FRY
                         I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland 
                         very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded 
                         out.
 
               
                                     MICHELLE
                         That's because you're a loser. You were 
                         a loser in the year 2000 and you're 
                         a loser in the year 4000.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it 
                         all. Several friends, a low-paying job, 
                         a bed in a robot's closet. I envied 
                         no man. But you wrecked everything.
 
                         
               
                                     MICHELLE
                         Quit standing up for yourself, Fry. 
                         When we get back to the hole, we are 
                         going to have a long, boring talk about 
                         our relationship!
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Oh, yeah? Well, listen to this: (whispering) 
                         I'm leaving you.
 
               
               [He runs away.]

               
               [Time Lapse. Fry walks alone through the misty desert.]

               
                                     FRY
                         There must be people somewhere.

               
               [He climbs a small hill and sees some lights in the distance. 
               He slips on some loose stones and bounces down the other side 
               of the hill.]
 
               
               [Time Lapse. The mist is thicker. Fry falls to the ground. The 
               mist clears a little and something comes into view.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Yes! Footprints! And hand prints?  But? 
                         What's happening?
 
               
               [He stands up and sees Loew's Gaddafi's Chinese Theater in front 
               of him. He steps back. The Planet Express ship lands beside him, 
               crushing a floodlight. People scatter. Leela, Bender and Farnsworth 
               walk off the ship.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Fry, thank God we found you.

               
                                     FRY
                         Leela? What are you guys doing here 
                         in the year 4000?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         It's not the year 4000.

               
                                     BENDER
                         You were only frozen for two days. Uh, 
                         by the way, I broke your bed.
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         You were in Pauly Shore's tube and they 
                         were delivering it to his movie screening.
 
                         
               
               [He points to the sign on the theatre; "Jury Duty II: Trouble 
               On The Hubble Starring Dr. Paul Shore. 1000th Anniversary Gala!"]
 
               
               
                                     LEELA
                         But, when they noticed you weren't him, 
                         they chucked you in a ditch.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         So you're saying these aren't the decaying 
                         ruins of New York in the year 4000?
 
                         
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         You wish! You're in Los Angeles!

               
                                     FRY
                         But there was this gang of 10-year olds 
                         with guns.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Exactly: You're in L.A.

               
                                     FRY
                         But everyone is driving around in cars 
                         shooting at each other.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         That's L.A.. for you.

               
                                     FRY
                         But the air's green and there's no sign 
                         of civilisation whatsoever.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         He just won't stop with the social commentary.
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         And the people are all phoneys. No one 
                         reads. Everything has cilantro on it 
                         -  Michelle, baby!
 
               
                                     MICHELLE
                         It's not working out, Fry.

               
               [The limo drives away. Pauly Shore pokes his head out of the 
               sunroof.]

                         (shouting) Tis better to have loved 
                         and lost, n'est ce-pas?
 
               
               [He laughs.]

               
               [Ship's Cockpit. Fry looks out of the window as the ship flies 
               back to New New York.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         That's it. I've had it with women. From 
                         now on, I'm concentrating on my career. 
                         Can I have my old job back?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Why, I've forgotten why I even fired 
                         you.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         'Cause he destroyed your business, your 
                         home and all your possessions.
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Oh, that's right. Get lost.

               
               [He pulls a lever and the floor opens up beneath Fry. He falls 
               out of the ship and screams.]
