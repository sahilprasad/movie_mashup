               shoots out the top of a bottle. Outside, a hummingbird's wings

               out the fire on Bender's burning arm. Fry squeezes his cheeks 
               and the flames go away. He puts Bender, Kif and Amy onto the 
               sofa with everyone else and wheels it out into the alley through 
               the fire door. He picks up a fire extinguisher and quickly puts
