                         but they produce an awful lot of trash.

                         You can't shoot penguins. Isn't there 
                         some way to prevent them from breeding?

                         Cold showers don't work on Antarctic 
                         creatures. Now surely you agree that 
                         a quick semi-painless death is a darn 
                         sight better than weeks of starvation.

                         joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins, 
                         not to hunt them.

                         Now are you with us or are you gonna 
                         let innocent penguins suffer?

                         Look nobody enjoys shooting penguins. 
                         But if you have to shoot penguins, well 
                         you might as well enjoy it.

                         So Leela, were you able to help the 
                         penguins?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Well sure. I mean...not really...I mean...nature 
                         will work itself out. It can't screw 
                         things up any worse than we did trying 
                         to fix things right?

                         (mumbling) I 'unno.

                         Ah, quit your worrying. Thanks to my 
                         shining influence those stupid birds'll 
                         do just fine.

               two abandoned guns. They pick the guns up, point them at each 
               other and cock them.]
