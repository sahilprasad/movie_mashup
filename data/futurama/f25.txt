                         Bender? No way!  I definitely would've 
                         noticed something.

                         Bender, why are you spending so much 
                         time in the bathroom? Are you jacking 
                         on in there?
 
               
                                     BENDER

                         it down after all those people caught 
                         salmonella from the flume ride.

                         You'll only win a smaller, silver fiddle. 
                         Also I guess I'll kill one of you, uh, 
                         him.

                         I could if you'd drop the stupid gold 
                         violin!
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Oh, sorry.

               
               [She drops it. It hits Beezlebot on the head. He squeals and 
               Fry, Leela and Bender escape through the hole.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Outisde The Inferno. They cheer.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         Don't worry, guys, I'll never be too 
                         good or too evil again. From now on, 
                         I'll just be me.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Uh, do you think you could be just little 
                         less evil than that.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         I don't know. Do you think you could 
                         survive a 700ft fall?
 
               
               [Fry chuckles.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Good old Bender!
