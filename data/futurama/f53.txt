                         for lunch to discuss my Hollywood dreams.

                         to be throw back!

                          You're unfunny and untalented. That's 
                         why you're perfect for drama.

                         right now, as we speak. The script is 
                         dynamite. I know because I wrote it 
                         myself. And with me directing and starring, 
                         I'll be back on top after 50 miserable 
                         years......uh, of fame.

                         Thank you. Thank you so much! You know, 
                         through all my ups and downs, I always 
                         thought the most important thing in 
                         life was to win an Oscar. But tonight 
                         I realise what's really important is 
                         to win two Oscars. Ha, ha! I'm kidding, 
                         I'm kidding. What really matters in 
                         life is that people care about you, 
                         whether it's a whole crowd......or just 
                         one die-hard fan.
