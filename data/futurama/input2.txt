                         Of course, since the greenhouse gases 
                         are still building up, it takes more

                         stop global warming at the same time! 
                         Granted you're all blasting out greenhouse

                         But we can use those very gases to save 
                         the planet. If you all vent your exhaust 
                         directly upward in one burst it should 
                         thrust the Earth further from the sun, 
                         thus cooling it.  By my calculations 
                         we'll need the full force of every last 
                         robot. So quickly, everyone point your 
                         exhaust vents straight upwards.  Now 
                         vent! Vent like the wind!  Harder! Harder!

               and brings it back into the vent. Fry groans from the heat.]

                         The person who gave up her whole evening 
                         to watch it. A whole evening of TV gone. 
                         What a mockery of justice it is that

                         But then again, I promised the coin

                         Wait a minute. If our universes are 
                         identical then why did our Leela look 
                         into the box and your Leela didn't?

                         Well to be honest I tossed a coin. It 
                         came up tails so I didn't look.

                         Interesting. Apparently the key difference 
                         between our universes is that coin flips 
                         have opposite outcomes.

                         Well then there's only one solution.

                         ...Have you ever tried simply turning 
                         off the TV, sitting down with your children, 
                         and hitting them?

                         Well, I'd say we all learned a valuable 
                         lesson about TV there.

                         Uh...that we should all take TV a little 
                         less seriously. And more importantly, 
                         turn it off once in a while.

                         made me smart? I could play the holophonor 
                         and it made Leela like me.  Hey Bender, 
                         as long as you know, I have a holophonor 
                         recital Tuesday and I'd really like

                         soul. Then one day I found someone else's 
                         couch fibres on his butt.

                         naked on her couch if I could just learn 
                         to play this stupid thing.

                         to metaphorically make a "deal with

                         Ah Fry, congratulations. Your latest 
                         performance was as delectable as dipping 
                         my bottom over and over into a bath 
                         of the silkiest oils and creams!
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Thank you sir, that's exactly what I 
                         was going for.
 
               
                                     HEDONISMBOT
                         You were the sole diversion in what 
                         has been a pale and unamusing season. 
                         And so I would feign commission you 
                         write an opera.

                         But, I've never written an opera.

                         And I've never heard one. Still, if 
                         you can keep me amused through the overture 
                         I shall consider it a smashing success.

                         But I wouldn't even know what to write 
                         about. Unless...  OK I'll do it. If 
                         I can make it about Leela.

                         shall see you at the premiere.

               the sound. She sees holographic silhouettes coming from underneath 
               a door like Bender did in the apartment.]

               notes on a music sheet.]

                         I-I don't want you to hear it 'til it's 
                         done.

                         'til it's cooked. This has to be perfect. 
                         I want you to hear exactly what I hear

                         incredible gift and I never knew. I've 
                         been a fool. A fully justified prudent 
                         fool.  They're so cold.

                         a boring dried up wasteland. And the 
                         only reason anybody ever comes here 
                         is for the tacky little amusement park. 
                         Can't you just accept that?
 
               
                                     FRY
                         I guess I can't.

               
               [They hear a shot from outside. They look through the transparent 
               barn doors and see Bender running out of the farmhouse.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Farmyard. The farmer chases him out of the house waving 
               his rifle.]
 
               
                                     FARMER
                         I'll learn ye to sleep with my robot 
                         daughters!
 
               
               [Bender runs into the barn.]

               
               [Cut to: Barn. He leans against the transparent door. Outside 
               the farmer reloads his gun.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         He'll never find me in here.

               
                                     LEELA
                         Bender?

               
                                     FRY
                         Oh, Bender. You didn't touch the Crushinator, 
                         did you?
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Of course not. A lady that fine you 
                         gotta romance first.
 
               
               [Another gunshot smashes the barn door behind Bender. Bender 
               legs it while the farmer reloads. Fry and Leela follow him through 
               another door. They pick up their helmets as they run.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Farmyard. They grab some oxygen tanks and get into the 
               moon buggy.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Lunar Surface. The buggy speeds away from the farm. 
               The farmer, in a spacesuit but with his cap sat on top, Lulabelle 
               7 and Daisy-Mae 128K run after them. The farmer fires a shot 
               at them and misses.]
 
               
                                     FARMER
                         Oh, no you don't! C'mere Crushinator.
 
                         
               
               [Crushinator drives out of the farm and pulls up beside him.]
 
               
               
                                     CRUSHINATOR
                         (mechanical voice) Yes, Pa.

               
               [She transforms into a car. The farmer and his other two daughters 
               get in and drive after Fry, Leela and Bender. They chase the 
               crew around past craters and through ravines. The farmer takes 
               a shot at the crew and narrowly misses them. The crew round a 
               corner and find their way blocked by a rock bridge.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         It's too low.

               
                                     LEELA
                         Hang on. Hang on. Jump.  Hold on to 
                         your helmet!
 
               
               [They jump the gorge, flying over crocodiles with space helmets 
               and land safely on the other side. They all cheer and then a 
               wheel falls off the buggy. The Crushintor approaches the other 
               side and stops. The farmer climbs out and slams the door.]
 
               
               
                                     FARMER
                         God darn, it Crushinator, jump!

               
                                     CRUSHINATOR
                         (mechanical voice) No, Pa. I love him.
 
                         
               
               [The farmer takes his hat off and jumps on it, groaning. Leela 
               looks at the broken wheel and Fry sees a huge shadow approaching.]
 
               
               
                                     FRY
                         Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!

               
               [Leela gasps.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         Nightfall's coming.  Hurry, before we 
                         freeze.
 
               
               [The flee from the shadow.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         What do you mean "we", mammal?

               
               [Cut to: Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. He watches the crew 
               through a telescope.]
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Oh, dear! I really ought to do something. 
                         But I am already in my pyjamas.
 
               
               [He falls asleep and starts snoring.]

               
               [Cut to: Lunar Surface. Fry and Leela are panting.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         We can't outrun it forever.

               
               [Fry sees something.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Over there! Look! It's the moon landing 
                         site! We found it!
 
               
               [They run towards it. Leela climbs the ladder and pushes over 
               the hatch.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Quick, get in.

               
               [Fry sees the American flag.]

               
                                     FRY
                         It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's 
                         footprint!  Hey! My foot's bigger! Leela, 
                         isn't this the greatest thing you've 
                         ever seen?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Fry, look around. It's just a crummy 
                         plastic flag and a dead man's tracks 
                         in the dust.  Now get in here before 
                         you freeze.
 
               
               [Fry sighs and climbs the ladder.]

               
               [Cut to: Apollo 11 Lander. Leela helps him in.]

               
               [Cut to: Lunar Surface. She closes the door just as Bender arrives.]
 
               
               
                                     BENDER
                         Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll 
                         go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack 
                         and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar 
                         lander and the blackjack. Ah, screw 
                         the whole thing.
 
               
               [He walks off.]

               
               [Apollo 11 Lander. Leela reads the oxygen gauge.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         Well if the oxygen holds out we might 
                         live long enough to starve to death.
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should 
                         have dragged you out here.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         That's right, you shouldn't have. I 
                         still don't get what the big attraction 
                         is.
 
               
               [Fry sighs.]

               
                                     FRY
                         I never told anybody this but a thousand 
                         years ago I used to look up at the moon 
                         and dream about being an astronaut. 
                         I just didn't have the grades. Nor the 
                         physical endurance. Plus I threw up 
                         a lot and nobody liked spending a week 
                         with me.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         A week would be a little much.

               
                                     FRY
                         The moon was like this awesome, romantic, 
                         mysterious thing, hanging up there in 
                         the sky where you could never reach 
                         it, no matter how much you wanted to. 
                         But you're right. Once you're actually 
                         here it's just a big dull rock. I guess 
                         I just wanted you to see it through 
                         my eyes, the way I used to.
 
               
               [Leela looks through a window. She sees the Earth.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         Fry, look. It really is beautiful. I 
                         don't know why I never noticed before.
 
                         
               
               [Bender runs towards the capsule.]

               thing with spikes.]

                         Had to come back for the Crushinator, 
                         eh, robot? Well I got you this time.
 
                         
               
               [The spikes get closer to Bender. The Planet Express ship swoops 
               in above them. The magnetic winch lowers towards Bender.]

                         he learns, he loves.

                         that. I must have been really acting

                         you'll be living which is great because,

                         and the one-eyed lady and the Chinese 
                         girl but everyone on this floor is having 
                         trouble with their TV reception.

                         causing it or we're outta this dump!

                         apartment that smelled like a sewer. 
                         You liked that one, right?

                         kinda settled in here.

                         Or we could live underground with the 
                         mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's 
                         boss!

                         we could do this with you going and 
                         me not going?

                         anyway. Won't you be just as happy back 
                         in your old place?

                         visit me here.

                         Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This 
                         way we'll both be happy.

                         a garbage can to put that dog in! Here

                         dog was fast-fossilised, preserving

                         to attempt to clone Fry's dog. Using 
                         the very same apparatus I used to clone 
                         you!  Ooo look, there's a smidge of

                         be a delivery boy next millenium!  What's 
                         with Seymour? Its like he don't want 
                         you to go. Or he thinks your pants is

                         Sorry, but we need to practice hand

                         can walk him. Of course, after he goes 
                         you have to refill the canisters. C'mere

                         May yet? Really?

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Indeed. You see, that fossil was made 
                         of dolomite. The tough black mineral 
                         that won't cop out when there's heat 
                         all about. By contrast, observe the 
                         lava's affect on this ice swan.  Of 
                         course, that would have melted even 
                         at room temperature. I just wanted to 
                         get rid of it. But had it been made 
                         of that righteous mineral dolomite, 
                         there's a slim chance it might have 
                         survived.

                         So Seymour might still exist?

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Perhaps. For a few minutes. It's dolomite 
                         baby!

                         15? You mean he lived for 12 more years

                         Think about it. Seymour lived a full 
                         life after I was gone. He probably added 
                         new songs to his repertoire.

                         when I knew him and that's when I loved 
                         him.  I'll never forget him. But he 
                         forgot me a long long time ago.

               then autumn, a snowy and rainy winter and back to spring. Panucci 
               gives Seymour a slice of pizza. It goes through autumn and winter 
               again. Seymour starts to age a little. The "U" from the "Panucci's 
               Pizza" sign falls on a man. An aged Panucci pats Seymour on the 
               head. Seymour continues waiting for Fry to return, and closes

                         the security cordon around Vergon 6. 
                         I'm anticipating an all-out tactical 
                         dogfight, followed by a light dinner...ravioli, 
                         ham, sundae bar.

                                     LEELA
                         Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship.
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?

               
                                     LEELA
                         Uh-huh!

               
                                     FRY
                         Who's the Zapp Brannigan?

               
               [Cut to: Nimbus Bridge. Zapp and Kif watch the ship approach.]
 
               
               
                                     KIF
                         Shall I fire on them now, sir?

               
                                     ZAPP
                         Not yet, Kif. In the game of chess, 
                         you can never let your adversary see 
                         your pieces.  What?
 
               
               [Cut to: Ships Cockpit.]

                         They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly 
                         saved the Octillian system from a horde 
                         of rampaging Killbots.

                         Wow!

               
                                     BENDER
                         A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we 
                         can always build more Killbots!
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         He's the most decorated captain in the 
                         whole Democratic Order Of Planets.

                                     LEELA
                         No I don't. But I think we ought to 
                         meet with him and see if he'll help 
                         us rescue those animals.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Well just in case you guys hit it off 
                         you'll wanna take this with you.
 
               
               [He holds up the fork.]

                                     KIF
                         Sir, they're headed straight for us.
 
                         
               
                                     ZAPP
                         A well-calculated move straight out 
                         of Sun Tzu's classic text The Art Of 
                         War, or my own masterwork: Zapp Brannigan's 
                         Big Book Of War.  But the one thing 
                         their captain doesn't realise and never 
                         will is that --
 
               
                                     KIF
                         Sir, they've docked with us and have 
                         come aboard.
 
               
                                     ZAPP
                         Then I have risked all and lost. Kif, 
                         old man, I'll be in the escape pod. 
                          If that wicker chair I like survives 
                         the slaughter, have it sent to my P.O. 
                         box.
 
               
               [The door opens and the Planet Express crew walk in. Zapp screams 
               and hides behind a chair. Leela looks around and sees Kif.]
 
               
               
                                     LEELA
                         Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet 
                         Express delivery ship. We've come aboard 
                         to plead for your assistance.
 
               
                                     KIF
                         Well, if there's anything --

               
               [Zapp jumps in front of Kif.]

                         I'm in command here. Zapp Brannigan. 
                         Has my fame preceded me or was I too 
                         quick for you?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Oh, not at all. I'm just so uh...really 
                         thrilled to meet you!
 
               
                                     ZAPP
                         You're an impressive piece of captain. 
                         Beautiful and deadly - a potent combination.
 
                         
               
                                     LEELA
                         (flattered) You don't mean that!

               
                                     ZAPP
                         But I do. I doubt I've seen more than 
                         three or four captains sexier than you, 
                         and only one who was deadlier.
 
               
               [He takes her hand and Fry leans in.]

                         I heard that one time you single-handedly 
                         defeated a horde of rampaging somethings 
                         in the something something system.
 
                         
               
                                     ZAPP
                         The Killbots? A trifle! It was simply 
                         a matter of outsmarting them.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Wow! I never would have thought of that!
 
                         
               
                                     ZAPP
                         You see, Killbots have a preset kill 
                         limit. Knowing their weakness, I sent 
                         wave after wave of my own men at them, 
                         until they reached their limit and shutdown. 
                         Kif, show them the medal I won.

                         going.
 
               
               [He carries on.]

                         talk to you about our mission.

                         Whatever it is, I'm willing to put wave 
                         after wave of men at your disposal. 
                         Right men?
 
               
               [He raises his glass to the crew.]

                         Vergon 6 from extinction. And if you 
                         could just --

                         The Democratic Order Of Planets prohibits 
                         interfering with undeveloped worlds.

                         Law".
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         But people already interfered. That 
                         planet was mined completely hollow.

                         mining crew.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         This doesn't make any sense.

                         Law. I merely enforce it.

                         if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw 
                         me in prison.

                         hit 70 blerns!

                         He's good, alright. But he's no Clem 
                         Johnson. And Johnson played back in 
                         the days before steroid injections were 
                         mandatory.

                         Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't 
                         have lasted one pitch in the old Robot 
                         Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there 
                         was a blern hitting machine!
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Exactly! He was a machine designed to 
                         hit blerns! I mean, come on, Wireless 
                         Joe was nothing but a programmable bat 
                         on wheels.

                         Oh, and I suppose Pitchomat 5000 was 
                         just a modified howitzer?
 
               
                                     LEELA

                         us on the field.

                         all kinds of robots down there.

                         Yeah, doing crap work! They're bat boys, 
                         ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But 
                         how many robot managers are there?

                                     BENDER
                         Zero!  And what a surprise! Look who's 
                         scraping up the filth. Is it a human 
                         child? I wish!

                         in. Everyone is to return to the office 
                         immediately.  Get away, you filthy bird! 
                         Shoo! Shoo! Professor, turn me off, 
                         quick!

                         Admit it: You all think robots are just 
                         machines built by humans to make their 
                         lives easier.

               a Planet Express label on it and "Chapek 9" written on it.]
 
               
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Great news, everyone. You'll be delivering 
                         a package to Chapek 9, a world where 
                         humans are killed on sight.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Why is that great news?

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         I'm glad you asked that question, Fry. 
                         You see, Chapek 9 was colonised centuries 
                         ago by a murderous crew of radical robot 
                         separatists.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Oh, so just 'cause a robot wants to 
                         kill humans that makes him a "radical"?
 
                         
               
                                     LEELA
                         Hey, hold on. I understand these robots 
                         hate humans, but how do they feel about 
                         humanoid aliens?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH

                         That's why Bender will have to make 
                         the actual delivery.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Oh, I get it, make the robot do all 
                         the work!

                         ever had to do around here.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot 
                         holiday.

                                     BENDER
                         Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks 
                         on the robot calendar.

                         Oh, come on, Bender. Last month it was 
                         Robomadom and before that Robonza.

                         It wasn't just a blast. It was a sacred 
                         tribute to my ancestral prototypes which 
                         happened to take the form of a drinking 
                         contest.

                         Now, look here, Bender. I respect your 
                         diversity to the extent the law requires 
                         but you used up all your days off when 
                         you had that bout with Roberculosis.
 
                         
               
                                     BENDER
                         Alright, I'll go. But so help me, I'll 
                         hold a grudge against every last stinking 
                         one of you for the rest of your lives.

                         So let me get this straight: This planet 
                         is completely uninhabited?
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         No. It's inhabited by robots!

               
                                     FRY
                         Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited 
                         by boxes.

                         OK, Bender, we're here. It's time to 
                         get to work.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Yes, Miss Leela. Tote that space barge, 
                         lift that space pale.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Now we can't land on the surface because 
                         those robots will kill Fry and me. So 
                         we'll have to stay up here and lower 
                         you with the winch. And remember: You 
                         don't know humans, you don't work for 
                         humans, and, above all, you don't like 
                         humans.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         (ironic) I'll try to keep that in mind!

                         too if I had to go to some uninhabited 
                         planet.

                         for him.

                         I felt terrible when I heard about your 
                         money troubles and I thought maybe I 
                         could help out a sweet young man by 
                         buying his anchovies.

                         control the robot oil business and I 
                         won't let you ruin me. How much do you 
                         want?

                         even more important. My friends. And

                         really do things right you gotta strangle 
                         yourself a fresh one.  Now this is why

                         first meal and he's a little sensitive. 
                         So let's be supportive, OK?

                         tasted. And I once a big heaping bowl

                         It's salt with water in it if that's 
                         what you mean.

                         There was nothing wrong with that food. 
                         The salt level was 10% less than a lethal 
                         dose.

                         things before you were born! I think 
                         I know what I'm doing.

                         So after I specifically asked you not 
                         to touch anything, you drank a bottle

                         just like the story of the grasshopper 
                         and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper 
                         kept burying acorns for winter while 
                         the octopus mooched off his girlfriend

                         came and the grasshopper died and the 
                         octopus ate all his acorns and also 
                         he got a racecar. Is any of this getting

                         We've gotta get the Emperor out of your 
                         body before they kill you!

                         Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in 
                         a high-speed centrifuge separating out 
                         the denser fluid of His Highness.

                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Oh, right, right, with the bones! I 
                         always forget about the bones.

                         dripped out through somebody's armpit.

                         I could vomit or urinate. Would you 
                         feel better about that?
 
               
                                     BONT
                         Slightly. But my favourite so far is 
                         the bone-crushing.

                         That's a great idea! Crying.

               
                                     BONT
                         Fine. That or the bone one.

                         too macho.

                         pimple on society's ass and you'll never 
                         amount to anything.

                         reminder: Everyone you knew or loved 
                         in the 20th century is dead.

                         OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 
                         'cause there's no God and your idiotic 
                         human ideals are laughable!

                         We should call Leela for help.

                         and wreck it by surviving.

                         We only got two drops.

               
               [There is a bang at the door. The Trisolians begin leaking in 
               through a hole. Bont chuckles.]

                         It's only a matter of time now.

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         I'll handle this!

               
               [He tries to block the leak with his claw and eventually gets 
               it under control by forcing one of his mouth flaps into the hole.]
 
               
               
                                     LEELA
                         Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out 
                         of this if you're willing to let me 
                         help you.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take 
                         all the help you're willing to give. 
                         I know you just want what's best for 
                         me.  Ow! What was that for?  Hey, come 
                         on!  That hurt!
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         I know. Amy, get the bottle.

               
               [She carries on beating Fry up while Amy holds the bottle under 
               his eye.]

                         Come on. Everybody help out Fry.

               
               [She slaps him again, Zoidberg pinches his leg with his claw 
               and Bender stubs out a cigar on his arm.]

                         all. You guys are true -- ow! Cut it 
                         out, Bender! That's a tender area!

                         Great! We're one-tenth of the way there.
 
                         
               
               [Time Lapse. Leela, Zoidberg and Bender are tired out. Amy keeps 
               kicking the Emperor out of Fry. She pants.]
 
               
                                     AMY
                         OK, it's your turn.

               
               [She points to someone. A Trisolian starts to hit Fry with a 
               chair.]
 
               
                                     FRY

                         I'm the Emperor! Thanks for crying me 
                         out.

                         Oh, you're welcome.

               cries in pain from inside.]

                         be making a delivery to Ebola 9, the

                         I want all of you to be alive. It's 
                         the Academy of Inventors annual symposium.

                         It's the event of the scientific season. 
                         Every member presents an invention and 
                         the best one wins the Academy prize.

                         Sounds boring.

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Oh, my, yes. But not this year, because 
                         my latest invention is unbeatable. Behold! 
                         The death clock.  Simply jam your finger 
                         in the hole and this readout tells you 
                         exactly how long you have left to live.

                         Well it's occasionally off by a few 
                         seconds. What with free will and all.

                         left to live?

                         Why don't you just leave me alone, Wernstrom?!

                         hill. It's time to leave science to 
                         the 120-year-olds.
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         You young turks think you know everything. 
                         I was inventing things when you were 
                         barely turning senile.

                         going to take a nap before the ceremonies.

                         student at Mars University. But then 
                         after one fateful pop-quiz...

                         later and still no revenge. I'm essentially

                         the spray-on toupee and - of course 
                         - the technology to keep human heads 
                         alive in jars.  But wait, there's more. 
                         We've got a whole line-up of inventors 
                         tonight, starting with that up and coming 
                         young star, Ogden Wernstrom.

                         evening, grandpa?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Let's just say it'll put you young whippersnappers 
                         in your place!

                         I just hope it's not as lame as that 
                         death clock you presented last year.

                         That's right.

                         Oh, my! Did it put you young whippersnappers 
                         in your place?
 
               
                                     WERNSTROM
                         Hardly! We laughed until our teeth fell 
                         out. Come along, Cinnamon.

                         Oh, dear, I'll have to invent something 
                         new in the next ten minutes. Perhaps 
                         some sort of death clock.

                         Our last presentation comes from our 
                         oldest member, Professor Hubert Farnsworth. 
                         Professor?
 
               
               [A spotlight falls on Farnsworth. He is scribbling something 
               on a piece of paper.]

               [Farnsworth snarls and runs onto the stage.]

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Uh, yes, here I am, OK, now, hello there. 
                         Now, we all know telescopes allow us 
                         to see distant objects. But what if 
                         we want to smell distant objects? Well 
                         now we can! Thanks to my new invention...the 
                         Smellescope.
 
               
               [He puts a piece of paper on a projector. The audience starts 
               talking.]

                         The odour travels past this coffee stain 
                         here, around the olive pit and into 
                         this cigar burn. And this appears to 
                         be a, doodle of myself as a cowboy. 
                          But the Smellescope is brilliant, I 
                         tell you! Think of the astronomical 
                         odours you'll smell thanks to me.  Oh, 
                         my!
 
               
               [He puts it back on the projector. It is smudged. The audience 
               laughs again.]

                         I've waited a hundred years for this, 
                         Farnsworth. I give your invention the 
                         worst grade imaginable: An A-minus-minus.

                         And now for the presentation of the 
                         award. Listen, folks, I'm practically 
                         giving this prize away to Dr. Wernstrom, 
                         for his fish thingy.
 
               
               [Wernstrom picks up the trophy and shakes his fish's leg. Farnsworth, 
               outside, sighs and walks away.]

                         Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a 
                         scientist.

                                     FRY
                         No, Professor, don't give up. There 
                         were plenty of times in my century when 
                         I was gonna give up but I never did. 
                         Never! Hey, are you even listening to 
                         me? Oh, I give up!
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         By God, you're right! I'm going to build 
                         that Smellescope!
 
               
               [Planet Express: Attic.]

               [Fry, Leela and Bender run in.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Did you build the Smellescope?

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         No, I remembered that I'd built one 
                         last year. Go ahead. Try it. You'll 
                         find that every heavenly body has its 
                         own particular scent. Here, I'll point 
                         it at Jupiter.
 
               
               [Fry sniffs.]

                         Smells like strawberries.

                         Exactly! And now Saturn.

                         Uranus.
 
               
               [He laughs.]

                                     FARNSWORTH
                         I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed 
                         Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke 
                         once and for all.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Oh. What's it called now?

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Urectum. Here, let me locate it for 
                         you.
 
               
               [Fry chuckles.]

                         No, no, I think I'll just smell around 
                         a bit over here!  Hmm.  Hmm.
 
               
               [He sniffs again and starts gagging.]

                         What is it?  Oh, jeez! Oh, man! Remarkable! 
                         A stench so foul is right off the funk-o-meter. 
                         I dare say Fry may have discovered the 
                         smelliest object in the known universe.

                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Hmm, perhaps the computer can calculate 
                         its trajectory.  My God! Whatever it 
                         is it's headed straight for us. With 
                         enough force to reduce this entire city 
                         to a stinky crater. We have less than 
                         72 hours.

                         Well, lets get looting!

                         So this thing's gonna destroy the whole 
                         city?  What the heck is it?
 
               
               [Farnsworth taps a keyboard.]

                         Ah! Just as I thought. The answer lies 
                         in this movie I found on the Internet.

                          New York City: the year 2000. The most 
                         wasteful society in the history of the 
                         galaxy and it was running out of places 
                         to empty its never-ending output of 
                         garbage.  The landfills were full. New 
                         Jersey was full. And so, under cover 
                         of darkness, the city put its garbage 
                         out to sea on the world's largest barge. 
                          The repulsive barge circled the oceans 
                         for 50 years but no country would accept 
                         it. Not even that really filthy one. 
                         You know the one I mean. Finally, in 
                         2052, the city used its mob connections 
                         to obtain a rocket and launch the garbage 
                         into outer space. Some experts claim 
                         the ball might return to Earth someday, 
                         but their concerns were dismissed as 
                         "depressing".

                         short-sightedness of Old New York, New 
                         New York is going to be destroyed by 
                         a giant ball of garbage.

                         back then? How could you just throw 
                         your garbage away?

                         I thank you, Professor Farnsworth. I 
                         now present you with the Academy prize, 
                         which we confiscated from Dr. Wernstrom

                         Bender clean up his act then I think 
                         we should be supportive.

                         There's nothing I can do. Now, if you'll 
                         just sign this fiddle contest waiver.

                         The Fairness In Hell Act of 2275 requires 
                         me to inform you that if you can best 
                         me in a fiddle contest, you win back 
                         Bender's soul. As well as a solid gold 
                         fiddle.

                         Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds 
                         of pounds and sound crummy?
 
               
                                     ROBOT DEVIL
                         Well it's mostly for show.

               
               [He picks up the fiddle and it glints in the light.]

                         (whispering) Do you know how to play 
                         the fiddle?

                         (whispering) No, do you?

               
                                     LEELA
                         (whispering) No, but I used to play 
                         the drums. They're sorta similar. (talking) 
                         What happens if we lose?
 
               
                                     ROBOT DEVIL
                         You'll only win a smaller, silver fiddle. 
                         Also I guess I'll kill one of you, uh, 
                         him.
 
               
               [He points at Fry. Fry gulps.]

                         Very well, then. Beat this.

               shoot laser rings at them. Bender grabs a pair of a bugbots wings 
               and flies in and grabs Fry and Leela who are swarmed by a crowd 
               of Hellbots with pitchforks. Bender ascends and heads for small 
               hole in the roof.]

               [A bugbot shoots three laser rings at the trio. Two miss but 
               one catches on Bender's antenna, forming a halo. The Hallejulah 
               chorus plays and they get closer to the hole. Hellbots pull chains 
               to close the hole.]

                         good or too evil again. From now on, 
                         I'll just be me.

                         less evil than that.

                         survive a 700ft fall?

                         (shouting) No. Luckily a family broke 
                         my fall.

                         Just hang on! I'll take care of that 
                         fire!

               [Cut to: Titanic Room. Bender lands in the middle of the room 
               and sprays the flames with water, extinguishing the fire. He 
               leaves the hose and hugs the Countess.]

                         Bender, you risked your life to save 
                         me.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third 
                         time. But that would be it.  When we 
                         kiss, I feel like I'm standing waist 
                         deep in a pool of cold, rising water.
 
                         
               
               [They both look down and see they are standing waist deep in 
               a pool of cold, rising water. They scream and shout as it gets 
               closer to their heads.]

               [There is a crash and the emergency airlock begins to close. 
               The crew rush forward to get under it. Zoidberg dives and wedges 
               his claw under it. It stops moving. Leela tries to lift it.]

               a dish cover with some spoons. Hermes squeezes under the door.

                         Wait a second. Aren't you a member of 
                         the yacht club?

                         Thank God there are plenty of escape 
                         pods; We won't have to dress up like

                         for Bender. The high gravity must be 
                         slowing down his looting.

                         Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see 
                         it I'll think back to that moment when

               Titanic deck seals. Bender and the Countess leap from the deck, 
               smashing through the glass airlock.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Outside Escape Pod. Bender and the Countess float towards 
               the pod and Bender reaches out his hand.]

                         I'm slipping, Bender. The pull is too

                         No! You have too much to live for. It 
                         may hurt for a while but one day you'll 
                         share your love again. After all, it's 
                         shareware.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Don't talk like that. Tragic romances 
                         always have a happy ending.

                         But she saved all our lives. Without

                         Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows 
                         what happens in a black hole. It's possible 
                         she's still alive in another dimension 
                         somewhere. Right, Professor?

                         much like Utah. But unlike Utah, it

                         monkeys. You've got the hat.

                         cool and it makes me smart but it doesn't 
                         make me happy.

                         here, maybe you should just go back 
                         to the jungle.

                         elected a super-villain governor, and

                         It may well be the cause of Bender's 
                         illness. But more importantly, it's 
                         a flimsy pretext to try out my latest

                         I call this the F-ray. It's like an 
                         X-ray only it allows you to see through 
                         anything - even metal. Now, the neutrino 
                         beam it emits is a tad dangerous, so 
                         you'll all need protective goggles.

               creatures across the river carrying barrels of Slurm. They have 
               orange faces and green hair and look like the Oompa-Loompas from

                         see our mix-ologists at work.  They 
                         take 900 of the finest ingredients, 
                         add a touch of child-like delight and 
                         mix it all with glacial spring water 
                         from our glacial spring water generator.

                         ingredient that makes Slurm so deliciously 
                         addictive.

                         And why is the Slurm pouring into this 
                         sewer?
 
               
               [Fry wrings some Slurm from his hair into his mouth and spits 
               it straight out.]

               door and they peer around it. It is the door from earlier that 
               was marked "Keep Out". On the other side one of the worm guards 
               smokes while another knits. A Grunka Lunka sleeps and two others

                         super Slurm!  It's so delicious, you'll 
                         eat until you explode! Oh, which reminds 
                         me, put a tarp over that sofa, will 
                         you? Bon appétit!
 
               
               [One of the Glurmos forces a spoonful of the Slurm into Fry's 
               mouth. Fry struggles then smiles.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Mmm!

               
                                     SLURM QUEEN
                         Farewell! Oh, and congratulations again 
                         on winning the contest.
 
               
               [She and the Glurmos laugh insanely and leave.]

                         Fry, untie us, quick!

               
                                     FRY
                         Here I come.  Let me just-- One more 
                         taste.
 
               
               [He takes three.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         You pig. Stop stuffing your craw and 
                         save us.
 
               
               [Fry walks towards her then changes his mind and sticks his head 
               into the tub. Bender moves closer to the machine.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         I can't see what's happening. Are we 
                         boned?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Yeah, we're boned.

               
               [Fry lifts his head out of the tub and looks around. He sees 
               Bender then Leela then looks back at the Slurm, A tear trickles 
               down his face and splashes into the Slurm.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         I can't stop eating this delicious ooze. 
                         But I'm not gonna let you die.
 
               
               [He moves towards the control unit, dragging the tub with him 
               and shovelling handfuls of Slurm into his mouth.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Hurry!

                         What's happening?  Just in time!

               
               [He looks down and screams. There is a hole in the middle of 
               his casing. Fry looks through it. While he is distracted, Leela 
               tips the tub of Slurm over and it disappears down a drain.]
 
               
               
                                     FRY
                         (screaming) Nooo!  (talking) I could 
                         fit if I didn't have these damn arms!
 
                         
               
               [He starts gnawing at his arms. Leela lifts him up off the floor.]
 
               
               
               [Wormulon Cave. The trio run through the tunnel.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         We're close to the exit. I can smell 
                         those filthy orange guys.
 
               
               [Ahead of them is Slurms MacKenzie and the babes.]

                         Slurms MacKenzie?

               
                                     SLURMS
                         Shh! I want you to take me with you.

                                     SLURMS
                         I'm partied out. All I want is to stay 
                         home and rent videos and watch them 
                         with a few friends. Is that so much 
                         to ask?
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Forget it pal.  It says on this bottle-cap 
                         you have to party with us.
 
               
                                     SLURMS
                         Alright, when we get to Earth. But please 
                         don't invite too many people, I wanna 
                         keep it small.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         No can do, Slurms!

               
               [He pats him on the back. The cave starts to shake and the Slurm 
               Queen bursts through the wall. Everyone screams.]
 
               
                                     SLURMS
                         This way!

               
               [He ushers them into another part of the cave. A sign above reads 
               "Danger Cave-In Area". The Slurm Queen follows but gets stuck. 
               She squirts some Slurm around her body as lubricant and squeezes 
               through.]

               [Slurms stops running.]

               
                                     SLURMS
                         Go on without me, I'll hold her off.
 
                         
               
               [Everyone else stops.]

                         But she'll crush you like a worm ... 
                         crushing a smaller worm.
 
               
                                     SLURMS
                         It's alright. I'm so tired of partying. 
                         So very tired.  I'll save you the only 
                         way I know how: By partying!  Babes.

                         You've served me well these 40 years, 
                         but this time I've got to party alone.
 
                         
               
                                     BABE

                                     SLURMS
                         There'll be other parties for you. Now 
                         go. Go!
 
               
               [They run away and Slurms dances and the Slurm Queen closes in. 
               The tunnel starts to collapse and Slurms turns the volume up 
               to maximum. More rocks fall from the roof. Bender turns around.]

               [Bigger rocks falls from above and they pile up in the tunnel. 
               One crushes Slurms and he yelps. The Slurm Queen slams into the 
               pile of rocks.]

                         secret!
 
               
               [She cries. The Glurmos arrive in time to see her drinking her

                         discovery: It seems that Slurm is produced 
                         in a colossal worm hiney!
 
               
               [On the screen, the commissioner sits in his office in front

                         testimony we'll finally be able to outlaw 
                         this insidious Slurm.

               they are chased by a dog (which is then eaten by the space monster 
               from The Empire Strikes Back). Back on Earth Sal delivers more 
               papers to them. At Maple Craters they pass Bret Blob's house.

                         believe humans really could mutate down 
                         there. Uh, due to exposure to toxic 
                         waste and radioactive runoff and good 
                         old American faeces.

                         feelings afterall.

                         anything from me, but I think I actually 
                         learned something from him.  (shouting)

               one of Zoidberg's people.]

                         Why, you're that disgraced starship 
                         captain.  Having him on staff will distract 
                         people from our horrendous safety record.

                          Anyway, whoever you all are, I have 
                         good news. You'll be making a delivery 
                         to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high 
                         gravity you'll most likely be crushed 
                         under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy.

                         working for that man. Once, he actually

                         a velour uniform. And I'm not convinced 
                         Leela has any of those things.

                         Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish 
                         she didn't make us work so much.

                         Back when I was captain all I asked 
                         from my men was their complete loyalty. 
                         If I had that, then for all I cared 
                         they could sit around the whole day 
                         drinking beer in their underpants.

                         I'd see the day. Come, Kif, let's eject.

                         wear.

                         with Captain Leela. She actually listens 
                         to what I have to--

                         Yes, but your body stayed on message. 
                         And that message is, "Look at my shiny 
                         new body". The robots ate it up. You've 
                         got real charisma from the neck down.

                         Xmas away from home.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Hey, hey. Let me aks you something: 
                         Would it cheer you up if we went and 
                         cut down an Xmas tree?

                         know, pine tree.
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Pine trees have been extinct for 800 
                         years, Fry. Gone the way of the poodle 
                         and your primitive notions of modesty.

               of the trunk. Amy takes a star out of a box and uses a jet pack 
               to get to the top of the tree. She hits her head on the ceiling.

                         get a fresh goose for goose burgers 
                         and my dad would whip up his special 
                         eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes. 
                          This dumb holiday just makes me think 
                         of all the things I left behind. Let's 
                         just stop talking about Xmas.

                         Zoidfarb.  Instead of "Claus" he writes 
                         "Claws"! Now that's humorous. Today's

                         puppies. And there would have to be

                         Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot Company 
                         built a robotic Santa to determine who'd 
                         be naughty and who'd been nice and distribute 
                         presents accordingly. But something 
                         went wrong.

                         Wait, you fool! Due to a programming 
                         error, Santa's standards were set too 
                         high and he invariably judges everyone 
                         to be naughty.

                         chop off your head and stuff your neck 
                         full of toys from his sack of horrors.

                         this way. Out of all of us he always 
                         seemed the most normal.

                         Edna, have you anything to say before 
                         begins the Claw-Plach?
 
               
                                     EDNA
                         I do. I just want to say that today 
                         I got up and I had a piece of toast. 
                         Then I brushed my teeth--

                         Fry, having guessed what animal I was 
                         thinking of, you shall have first choice 
                         of weapon.  And you, doctor?
 
               
                                     ZOIDBERG

                         pleasure of chopping him right here 
                         in the gonads!

                         Fry, I've never asked you for anything 
                         before but if it's not too much trouble, 
                         when it comes to the ninth round just 
                         let him win.

               around and Fry does the same with his nutcrackers and whacks 
               himself in the eye. Zoidberg scratches a "Z" in Fry's shirt à 
               la The Mark of Zorro then scratches "DR" above it. Fry squeals 
               and backs away. A bright light starts to shine in his eye. He 
               squints and tries to avoid it.]

               lands in the mud and Fry chuckles. Zoidberg stands on his hands, 
               kicks off his sandals and starts chasing Fry, clacking at him 
               with his foot claws. The crowds cheer.]

                         or its dumb customs. But is squeezing 
                         each others brains out with a giant

                         I'd never felt before: Love, jealousy, 
                         passion for disembowling. I owe it all

                         to Europa? We could have a picnic and

                         we sort of think exactly alike, and 
                         junk.

                         out. Hangin out? She's getting way too

                         us, I can't be alone with her.

                         chocolate but then you start to get 
                         tired of it because it always wants

                         banking regulations are a product of 
                         five different regulatory traditions.

                         Perhaps. But there is more to winning 
                         than beating your opponent. You lack

                         Hello and welcome to a remarkable championship 
                         bout. Destructor, a robotic armoured 
                         tank whose very use at battle has been 
                         ruled a war crime versus, Gender Bender,

                         This could be the most one-sided fight 
                         since 1973 when Ali faced an 80-foot 
                         tall mechanical Joe Frazier. M-My memory's 
                         not what it used to be but I think the 
                         entire Earth was destroyed.

                         tonight stand at an unprecedented 1000-0: 
                         A bet of $0 on Bender pays $1000 if 
                         he wins. Still, very few takers.

               the workings á la Modern Times. He comes out the other end like 
               a slinky. He rolls down some steps and into some boiling lava. 
               Farnsworth appears again and before he can speak Leela and Fry 
               shoot him. Fry shoots at Leela but misses. She shoots back and 
               he ducks behind a machine. Leela folows him warily. Someone backs 
               into her and she screams and turns around. It is another cyclops.]

                         I saw you in the chatroom but you left 
                         before I had a chance to talk to you. 
                         After all these years of searching for 
                         another Cyclops.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         I can't believe it. I've dreamed of 
                         this moment all my life.

                         Fry, you idiot. Ever since I was abandoned 
                         on Earth I've been searching for who 
                         my people are and where they come from. 
                         Then I finally meet another Cyclops 
                         and you blast him. You wrecked my one 
                         chance to learn who I am.

                         anything I can ever do -  Gotcha!  I 
                         won! I'm the greatest!

                         your once in a lifetime chance to learn

                         win a video game. Now lets concentrate

                         hear it but Alkazar's a jerk, he's bad

                         obvious to me! He's crude and gross 
                         and he treats me like a slave.

                         I can't. If I leave Alkazar then that's 
                         the end of the Cyclops race. And I won't 
                         let that happen. Even if that means 
                         a lifetime of unhappiness.

                         Hey everyone jam a sock in your spit 
                         faucets.  Not long ago I spent my lonely 
                         nights renting slash flicks with Rat 
                         Man and his girlfriend. But then a beautiful 
                         woman arrived and - stop eating pig! 
                         And she brought new hope for me and 
                         our once great civilisation. Now a million 
                         centuries of Cyclops destiny depend 
                         on the answer to one question......Leela, 
                         will you marry me?

                         Mr Bender about last night. that was 
                         just a...a misunderstanding.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Oh you didn't understand? Well let me 
                         explain. You......were having sex with 
                         you.

                         No. You see, a bureaucrat of my rank 
                         isn't supposed to fraternize.

                         That's what makes it so juicy. Its the 
                         forbidden fruit angle everybody loves. 
                         First I'll say "You'll never guess who 
                         saw Fry and Morgan doing it!" and they'll 
                         say "Who Bender, who?" and I'll say 
                         "It was lovable......old Bender."

                         I downloaded his brain. Everything that 
                         is Bender is right here. His mind, his

                         efficiency 4% if they used the empty 
                         carts to haul in heavy mining machinery.

                         my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely 
                         reduced pay of course.

                         But on my planet, we have to suffer

                         of a doctor -- If you want your parents 
                         to roll over in their graves!

                         not some slick, big-city lawyer like 
                         my opponent here.  But I am a veteran 
                         who has fought for his planet. You see 
                         this hand of mine?

                         No, you don't  'Cause I lost my real 
                         hand plantin' the flag when we took 
                         back Halley's Comet! Yet it was worth 
                         it. So much do I love that flag.  I 
                         love it even more than I love my seven 
                         wives. That's right, I'm a polygamist. 
                          Yet I would gladly eat a flag myself, 
                         had I not used my intestine as a rope 
                         to hoist a flag made of my own skin, 
                         if it would protect the freedoms of 
                         the proud people who salute that flag. 
                          Freedom such as polygamy.  I rest my 
                         case.  Whoa, jeez!

                         six to three, we find that flag eating 
                         is not protected by the constitution.

                         bite of the flag for tomorrow's papers?

                         that's a grand old flag!  I wonder what 
                         the Shroud of Turin tastes like.

                         should I?" Then later Leela made the

                         Not at all. It's very simple.

                         Now that's impossible. It came to me 
                         in a dream and I forgot it in another

                         imagine it. That's what being is a scientist 
                         is all about.

                         man.

                         winner!
 
               
               [An old boot comes out of the water on the end of the harpoon. 
               Leela sighs.]
 
               
                                     AMY
                         Oh, so this is where you shop for your 
                         boots?
 
               
               [Fry reels in a little fish.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         Couple more of those and you'll have 
                         yourself a fish stick!
 
               
               [He laughs.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish 
                         nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's 
                         bigger than anything you've caught. 
                          Ow! My small intestine!
 
               
               [Leela tries again with the harpoon.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times 
                         heavier than a boot.
 
               
               [She pulls out a crate marked "Boots 10 Pair" and sighs.]

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         You'll never catch anything with that 
                         primitive technology. What you need 
                         is this fish pheromone.  The most potent 
                         aphrodisiac known to fishkind.  Uh-oh!
 
                         
               
               [Several fish leap up to his head. He screams and knocks them 
               off. Zoidberg comes up behind him and sniffs him.]
 
               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         (sexfully) I'm so into you!

               
               [He wraps his mouth flaps around Farnsworth's head and slurps.]
 
               
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Oh, my!

               
               [Fry reels in his line. There is big fish attached to it.]

               
                                     FRY
                         (shouting) Hey, Bender, I just caught 
                         a fish this big!
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this! 
                          If I'm not gonna catch a fish, I might 
                         as well not catch a big fish.  There. 
                         Like most of life's problems this one 
                         can be solved with bending.
 
               
               [He ties the ships tether line to the hook.]

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Bender, be careful. That's the ships 
                         diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable.
 
                         
               
                                     BENDER
                         Then why do I have to be careful?

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         It belonged to my grandmother.

               
               [Bender takes some food from Hermes' hands, attaches it to his 
               hook and throws it into the sea.]
 
               
                                     HERMES
                         My manwich!

               
               [Time Lapse. Dusk approaches. Fry is asleep in a chair with his 
               rod next to him, Amy is asleep, Hermes is asleep with sign hanging 
               around him saying he will be awake at 7pm. Bender snoozes, his 
               door opening and closing. Leela casts her harpoon again.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Wake up, everyone! I've got something. 
                         And this time it's alive!  Dr. Zoidberg, 
                         since when do you even wear boots?
 
                         
               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         I wasn't wearing it. (ashamed) I was 
                         eating it.
 
               
               [Leela sighs and lets go of the rope.]

                         Come on, let's go home.

               
               [Amy wakes up and screams.]

                         Sunburn! My fabulous body! It's ruined! 
                         What happened to my parasol?
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         I don't know. It wasn't here when I 
                         took your umbrella.  What? I put sunblock 
                         on you.
 
               
                                     AMY
                         Well it didn't work!

               
               [She turns around and stomps off. On her back Bender has spelled 
               out "Honk If Bender Is Great" in sunblock. He giggles.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and 
                         let's go.
 
               
               [Bender tries to pull in the line.]

                         Hey, I'm snagged.

               
               [The line starts to whirr away.]

                         It's not snagged, the mechano man has 
                         caught something!  Sweet Zombie Jesus! 
                         It's huge!

               ship. The staff gasp.]

               away.]

                         It's pulling us under! Everyone into

                         diamond filament!  Well, at least I'll 
                         die with my friends. Hello?
 
               
               [The others shut the turret door behind them and the water line 
               creeps towards Zoidberg. He climbs in and shuts it behind him. 
               The ship lurches forward and disappears under the water and the 
               staff scream. Something floats to the surface.]

                         Dear Lord, that's over 150 atmospheres

               [More creaking. The depth gauge reaches 6000ft and breaks. Farnsworth's 
               glasses break and so do Bender's eyes. He screws some new ones 
               in.]

                         That should do it.

                         miles below the surface, we don't have

                         like this.  Now, the first order of 
                         business is lunch. I suggest a nice

                         and I will get to work on the ship. 
                         Bender, Zoidberg, since you can survive 
                         underwater, you'll go out and look for 
                         food.

                         mermaid. The poor demented honky.

                         It's ocean madness alright. Sailors 
                         call it aqua dementia, the deep down 
                         crazies, the wet willies, the screaming 
                         moist!

                         need oxygen.

                         I got it covered.  In the event of an 
                         emergency, my ass can be used as a floatation 
                         device.

                         to meet my daughter, Umbriel. Umbriel, 
                         these are some Yankees.

                         So, Fry, Atlanta was an American city 
                         in your time?
 
               
                                     FRY
                         I think it was just an airport. They 
                         had a place where you could buy nuts.
 
                         
               
                                     UMBRIEL
                         No! Ancient Atlanta was more than just 
                         a Delta hub. It was a vibrant metropolis, 
                         the equal of Paris or New York.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         That's right, honey! Whatever you say.

                         the, uh, the airport.

                         But tell us: How could a city with such 
                         a ... fabulous airport, end up underwater?

                         Ah, now that's a story that can only 
                         rightly be told in a Chamber of Commerce 
                         video narrated by folk-rock trubadour 
                         Donovan.
 
               
               [He presses a button and Donovan appears on the screen and strums

                          Atlanta was a city, landlocked, hundreds 
                         of miles from the area we now call the 
                         Atlantic Ocean,
 
               Yet so desperate the city's desire for tourism that they moved 
               offshore, becoming an island and an even bigger Delta hub,
 
               
               
               [On the screen, helicopters lift the city and land it in the 
               ocean. The scene changes to years later. The island is packed 
               with buildings.]
 
               Until the city over-developed and it started to sink,

               Knowing their fate, the quality people ran away,

               Ted Turner, Hank Aaron, Jeff Foxworthy, the guy who invented 
               Coca-Cola, the magician and the other so-called gods of our legends,
 
               
               Though gods they were -- and also Jane Fonda was there.

               
               [A boat with the people on pulls away and the city sinks.]

               The others chose to remain behind on their porches with their 
               rifles, and one day evolve into mermaids, and sing and dance 
               and ring in the new.
 
               
                                     MERMAIDS

                         Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions 
                         of years to evolve into mermaids?

                         Normally, yes, but the caffine really 
                         sped things up.  That stuff's wonderful.

                         should be going. I miss me wife and

                                     FRY
                         Wait. I'm not going with you.

                         Braves but it's a third-rate symphony.

                         be reasonable. Don't you realise that 
                         if you stay at this depth your body 
                         will permanently adapt to the pressure?

                         I'm fine thank you. A real pilot can 
                         navigate by feel alone.

                         they surrender, we go aboard, somebody 
                         does some clamping then we heist the

                         Correct. I found a giant hideous ape 
                         that looks exactly like Leela.

                         a jabbering mental patient. Isn't that

                         for you. He didn't even try to second-degree

               up behind a bomb. Another ball pushes the first four balls and, 
               like a Newton's Cradle, the bomb is pushed away. It rolls past 
               Fry and stops between Leela, Bender and the hick. They scream 
               and the fuse burns away. Bender crawls towards it.]

                         The elders tell of a young ball much 
                         like you. He bounced three metres in 
                         the air. Then he bounced 1.8 metres 
                         in the air. Then he bounced four metres 
                         in the air. Do I make myself clear?

                         they don't stop bouncing and jiggling,

                         people wanna hear when they first wake 
                         up.  Bathroom's that way.

                         on track. Why'd you freeze yourself?

                         a turn for the worse. I got married.

                         attended a law school so prestigious, 
                         the basketball team was coached by Ruth 
                         Bader Ginsberg.  I put him through law

                         lessen my pain: A carnival. Unfortunately,

                         panel of the Spizzler, and I had to

                         didn't know what had happened to you 
                         - no one did. The police were going 
                         to conduct a search but your parents

                         but your friends are a bunch of freaks.

                         I just don't belong here. I don't know 
                         anyone, I can't find a vanishing cream 
                         that doesn't make me actually vanish. 
                         I don't even have a job.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Oh, right. I was supposed to assign 
                         you a job. Let me just get your career 
                         chip installed.  Hold out your palm. 
                          What are you scared of? It's just like 
                         getting your hand pierced.

                         This world is horrible. Let's start 
                         over, Fry. Well go someplace where all 
                         we have is each other.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Ooh, romantic. I'll tell Bender to meet 
                         us there.

                         Whoa, whoa, girl. I thought you were 
                         talking about one of those motels where 
                         the bed is shaped like stuff.

                         Well, sure. To the extent a man can 
                         love a woman. But this seems like a 
                         big step.
 
               
                                     MICHELLE
                         Fry, why must you analyse everything 
                         with your relentless logic? Nothing 
                         matters but our love.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         You're right. Let's do this now and 
                         let's never regret it.

                         both rue and lament it.

                         I miss the year 3000 when life was simple 
                         and brains flew through space and everyone 
                         ate lasers.

                         that attractive in a man. Now come on, 
                         build us a shelter.

                                     BUTCH'S GIRLFRIEND
                         Every Monday and Wednesday's the same 
                         thing.
 
               
               [They get into the car and drive away.]

                         I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland 
                         very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded 
                         out.
 
               
                                     MICHELLE
                         That's because you're a loser. You were 
                         a loser in the year 2000 and you're 
                         a loser in the year 4000.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it 
                         all. Several friends, a low-paying job, 
                         a bed in a robot's closet. I envied 
                         no man. But you wrecked everything.
 
                         
               
                                     MICHELLE
                         Quit standing up for yourself, Fry. 
                         When we get back to the hole, we are 
                         going to have a long, boring talk about 
                         our relationship!
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Oh, yeah? Well, listen to this: (whispering) 
                         I'm leaving you.
 
               
               [He runs away.]

               
               [Time Lapse. Fry walks alone through the misty desert.]

               
                                     FRY
                         There must be people somewhere.

               
               [He climbs a small hill and sees some lights in the distance. 
               He slips on some loose stones and bounces down the other side 
               of the hill.]
 
               
               [Time Lapse. The mist is thicker. Fry falls to the ground. The 
               mist clears a little and something comes into view.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Yes! Footprints! And hand prints?  But? 
                         What's happening?
 
               
               [He stands up and sees Loew's Gaddafi's Chinese Theater in front 
               of him. He steps back. The Planet Express ship lands beside him, 
               crushing a floodlight. People scatter. Leela, Bender and Farnsworth 
               walk off the ship.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Fry, thank God we found you.

               
                                     FRY
                         Leela? What are you guys doing here 
                         in the year 4000?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         It's not the year 4000.

                         You were only frozen for two days. Uh, 
                         by the way, I broke your bed.
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         You were in Pauly Shore's tube and they 
                         were delivering it to his movie screening.

                                     LEELA
                         But, when they noticed you weren't him, 
                         they chucked you in a ditch.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         So you're saying these aren't the decaying 
                         ruins of New York in the year 4000?

                         But there was this gang of 10-year olds 
                         with guns.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Exactly: You're in L.A.

               
                                     FRY
                         But everyone is driving around in cars 
                         shooting at each other.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         That's L.A.. for you.

               
                                     FRY
                         But the air's green and there's no sign 
                         of civilisation whatsoever.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         He just won't stop with the social commentary.

                         reads. Everything has cilantro on it 
                         -  Michelle, baby!

                         It's not working out, Fry.

                         That's it. I've had it with women. From 
                         now on, I'm concentrating on my career. 
                         Can I have my old job back?

               fades to the night sky of a planet. The clouds in the sky merge 
               into outlines of Fry and Leela. The outlines kiss and a flash 
               radiates from their lips. The holophonor has changed to an undersea 
               setting. Two seals that look like Fry and Leela swim around with 
               each other. They swim to the top of the sea and leap into the 
               air beneath the full moon in the sky. A wave sweeps past the 
               moon and spills onto the shoreline. On the beach a clam shell 
               opens and in it's pearl the formally dressed Fry and Leela dance 
               some more. Fry lifts Leela into the air and the pearl flashes 
               into hundreds of white sparks that fall around the mesmerised 
               Leela's head. Fry's sonnet ends and Leela is speechless. She 
               takes Fry's hand and walks with him into the bedroom.]

                         you are Fry. I haven't felt this happy

                         I am Kif of the clan Kroker. I come 
                         to bear my young.

                          As it is written "and both shall lift 
                         the jug together". Where is your smizmar?

                         I'm probably just making you feel worse.

                         I will have the strength of two.  Apparently 
                         Amy hasn't been working out much lately.

                         your beloved smizmar.  Oh right sorry, 
                         but I memorised the ceremony by heart 
                         and it mentions her a lot.

                         Hey, according to the scab handbook 
                         that's extremely inappropriate banter.

                         things from a new perspective has reminded 
                         me of life's beauty. Or perhaps my new

               away in dismay so Bender throws the ball at the man in the stall,

                         OK, I've constructed an elaborate lie: 
                         I'll call Angleyne while pretending 
                         to be Flexo, arrange a date, show up 
                         disguised as him and catch her two-timing 
                         me with myself.

                         Hey, Flexo.  So since when do you go 
                         to bars on work nights? It's not like 
                         you at all.
 
               
                                     BENDER

                         Well he may be a walking factory but 
                         believe me he is no wuss. Now look. 
                         You and me are through. I told you that 
                         when I divorced you.

                         us closer. Care to dance?

                         wanted to make up to you.  Hey, scratchmo. 
                         How 'bout dropping me and the lady some 
                         rump-rattling beats?

                         he flashed his cash my rage would have 
                         subsided. Sadly that has not happened.

                         You have really loosened up!
 
               
                                     BENDER

               [He grabs Angleyne and tilts her back and she laughs.]

                         So the moral of the story is: If you 
                         want it to stay sunk, tie a weight to 
                         it!

                         eh? I'd better seduce her a little more, 
                         just to be sure.

               cut the man's moustache completely off. The man is shocked and 
               exclaims "You are a buffoon. Now cut my beard". The barber puts 
               shaving foam over the man's chin and cuts his head off. The man's

                         Thank you. Thank you so much! You know, 
                         through all my ups and downs, I always 
                         thought the most important thing in 
                         life was to win an Oscar. But tonight 
                         I realise what's really important is 
                         to win two Oscars. Ha, ha! I'm kidding, 
                         I'm kidding. What really matters in 
                         life is that people care about you, 
                         whether it's a whole crowd......or just 
                         one die-hard fan.

               behind him. Next he prepares to sit on some eggs to keep them 
               warm but accidentally squashes them instead. He looks embarrassed 
               and covers the yolk stain on him with his tux tails. In the water 
               penguins catch one or two fish in their beaks and Bender uses 
               his antenna to harpoon three at once. Back on land Bender stands

               penguin regurgitate food for the little ones. He picks up a fish

                         will help the environment or not. But

                         of a human.  What?
 


rk City Street. Fry and Bender walk down a busy street 
               and Bender sings and dances.]

                         (singing) Froggy went a-courtin' and 
                         he did ride, uh-huh, uh-huh
 
               Well, Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride

               Blah blah blah, something, Bender is great!

               Froggy went a-courtin' and Bender is great, uh-huh -

               
               [A rumbling noise interrupts his singing. He and Fry look through 
               a gap in a fence and see Sal in a hover-digger digging a huge 
               hole at the NNYC Hole Project. Sall dumps a load down on the 
               ground. Amongst some rubble and mud is a bag of fat free potato 
               chips. Fry picks it up.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Oh my God! They dug up a bag of olestra 
                         chips from my time!  There must be layers 
                         and layers of old stuff down there.
 
                         
               
               [Sal dumps another scoop-ful and amongst the dirt is an entire 
               VW minivan. Fry gasps.]

                         What's that? One of those Led Zeppelins 
                         I've heard so much about?
 
               
               [Fry puts his hands on the VW.]

                         No, it's an old Volkswagen van.  (shouting) 
                         Hey, Mister? Mind if I take this old 
                         van?
 
               
                                     SAL
                         (shouting) Sure. You wanna dump the 
                         corpses out of theres, it's yourses.

               VW into the hangar. He is wearing the previous owner's bandana.

                         What's that? One of those Jefferson 
                         Starships I've heard so much about?

                         It's called a van, and in light of the 
                         fact that it's not a-rockin', I invite 
                         you to come a-knockin'!

                         Hey, the speedometer only goes up to 
                         80. This thing can't go faster than 
                         80,000 miles an hour?

                         Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas. 
                         Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038.

                         Oh, no, I'm not going near it. Last 
                         time, that magnetic psycho nearly cut 
                         my head off.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Oh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up 
                         your inhibition unit and makes you sing 
                         folk songs.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         What? Who said anything about me secretly 
                         wanting to be a folk singer? How ridiculous.

                         now, your fear will own you, and nothing 
                         that can opener could ever do could 
                         be worse than that.

                         OK, OK, I can do this. It's time to 
                         take life by the cans.

                         send Patch Cord Adams back in?

                         other people suffering. That's kind 
                         of a pick-me-up.  Wow, that was great.

                         I dunno. Let me see.  Oh my God, you're 
                         Beck! I'd get up to shake your hand 
                         and steal your wallet but my crappy 
                         body crapped out on me.

                         Don't take it so hard. I used to miss 
                         my body too but then I fished this manequin 
                         out of the 92c Store dumpster.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Wow. We've sure got a lot in common, 
                         Beck. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet 
                         who transcends genres even as he re-invents 
                         them, just like you.
 
               
                                     BECK

                         looks.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Eh, thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll 
                         never be a musician now.
 
               
                                     BECK
                         Or maybe you'll be the best musician 
                         ever.

                         Thank you. That song doesn't usually 
                         last three hours, but we got into a 
                         serious thing...and then I forgot how 
                         it ended. Anyway, one last item of business 
                         before we go.

                         way you moved those stars around was 
                         really wonderful. I got you something.

                         Perhaps we could explode the whole damned

                         No, man. An explosion big enough to 
                         destroy that mama would take out half

                         up a little, Farnsy. Make it an implosion.

                         might just form a black hole that would

                         and we're Americans. This is our chance.

                         a duo? Yeah duos are good. Of course 
                         sometimes they're a little short handed. 
                          See ya. With two humans you'd think 
                         there'd be a robot in there...to balance 
                         things out. But, whatever.  I have these 
                         three costumes you could use. But, I 
                         guess I'll just throw one away.

                         street, that's an awfully long way to 
                         go for making out.

                         Did you notice what went wrong in that 
                         scene? Ordinarily Billy would work hard 
                         to make money from his paper route then 
                         he'd use the money to buy dinner for 
                         Mavis, thus earning the slim chance 
                         of performing the reproductive act. 
                         But in a world where teens can date 
                         robots why should he bother? Why should 
                         anyone bother? Let's take a look at 
                         Billy's planet a year later.  Where 
                         are all the football stars?  And where 
                         are the biochemists?  They are trapped 
                         - trapped in a soft, vice-like grip 
                         of robot lips. All civilisation was 
                         just an effort to impress the opposite 
                         sex. And sometimes the same sex. Now, 
                         let's skip forward 80 years into the 
                         future. Where is Billy?

                         and bone turn to minerals. Realising 
                         that, it was a simple matter to reverse 
                         the process. I've already tested it 
                         by turning the toaster into a racoon.

                         . I'll never forget the night that cute 
                         little alien baby was abandoned on our 
                         doorstep. Because I have a photographic 
                         memory and I remember every night!

                         you're an alien. What a beautiful gigantic

                         on to become a county-certified starship 
                         captain. And so it is my pleasure today, 
                         to nail her picture alongside those

                         who my parents were. All that matters

                         to make it on my own, just like all

                         try to keep my sadness pent up inside 
                         where it can fester quietly as a mental 
                         illness.

                         really wanted was a mom and dad, to 
                         hold me and stroke my hair and tell 
                         me they loved me.

                         feeling that somewhere, on some unknown 
                         planet, circling a distant star, my

                         in Alienese, so no-one on Earth can 
                         translate it. Not even Brainzilla.

                         it?  Of course, even if it is possible

                         This is an outrage. What's the point 
                         of pulling the biggest pool caper ever, 
                         if nobody knows you did it?

                         of things to a lot of people, but looking

                         definately big alright. I just wonder

                         by setting fire to the distillery and 
                         blowing this whole place to rubble!

                         running pretty well without my meddling 
                         - huh?  Atomic bombs? Oh no! Those unbelievers 
                         from my backside must have found my

                         not God, but the remains of a computerised 
                         space probe that collided with God.

                         you think what I did was wrong?
 
               
                                     GOD
                         Right and wrong are just words. What 
                         matters is what you do.

                         Yeah I know, that's why I asked if what 
                         I did - forget it.
 
               
                                     GOD
                         Bender, being God isn't easy, if you 
                         do too much, people get dependent. And 
                         if you do nothing, they lose hope. You 
                         have to use a light touch, like a safecracker 
                         or a pickpocket.

                                     GOD
                         Yes, if you make it look like an electrical 
                         thing. When you do things right, people

                         there is virtually no chance of finding 
                         him. It's time to give up.

                         on more than one occasion he, he actually 
                         stole my blood.  But still, I wish I

                         I'm sure their God will let them out

                         Back in the 1980's I was the toast of 
                         Wall Street. I was having whiskey with 
                         Boesky and cookies with Milken. But 
                         then, I was diagnosed with terminal 
                         boneitis.

                         There was no cure at the time. One drug 
                         company was close but I arranged a hostile 
                         takeover and sold off all the assets. 
                         Made a cool hundred mil.  Naturally 
                         I froze myself until a cure was found. 
                         Now here I am, ready to sleaze my way 
                         back to the top, 80's style!

                         Leonard.
 
               
                                     NIMOY
                         Bill, you are, and always shall be, 
                         my friend. But I just signed a six-month 
                         lease on my apartment. I can't walk 
                         away from a commitment like that.
 
                         
               
                                     SHATNER
                         Very well, my friend.

               Nimoy behind.]

                         (crying) Why did the world turn its 
                         back on our obvious greatness?
 
               
                                     FRY
                         I'm literally angry with rage! Your 
                         co-stars may be gone but we can still 
                         get those episode tapes back for the 
                         whole world to see. Come on!

                         But we have to! The world needs Star 
                         Trek to give people hope for the future.

                         'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like 
                         how you should accept people, whether 
                         they be black, white, Klingon or even 
                         female. But most importantly, when I 
                         didn't have any friends, it made me 
                         feel like maybe I did.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I 
                         guess I can't let you go alone.

                         I'll go too, with Leonard's permission, 
                         of course.

                         undercover so I'm blanking your memory.

                         for a second? Oh well. Let's go home 
                         you dumb poop machine.

                         Oh. Thank you. You know what Fry. I 
                         don't care if you're not the most important 
                         person in the universe. It really makes

                         This is no ordinary honey. It's produced 
                         by vicious space bees. A single sting

                         death took only 15 seconds. Yet the 
                         pain was so intense that it felt to 
                         him like 15 years. And it goes without 
                         saying that it caused him to empty his 
                         bowels.  We now commend Fry's body to

                         Well, I feel better now. Pawning all 
                         the stuff in Fry's locker helped give 
                         me closure.

                         Was there anything in there that might 
                         have been a gift for me?
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         No. Nothing. Not at all. No way José! 
                          Here it is.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         You took this from Fry's locker?

                         That proves it. Fry is alive somewhere 
                         and he's reaching me in my dreams.

                         If Fry is out there then Leela's brain 
                         could be acting as a five pound ouija 
                         board.

                         Some sort yes. In France it's called 
                         a "guillotine."

                         without removing it?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Yes. Easily.

                         when we buried him? Y'know like Julia 
                         Roberts?

                         Well I suppose there's a slim -  I don't 
                         believe it!

                         What is it? Is Fry alive in some other 
                         dimension or something?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         No. According to this gizmometer, Fry 
                         is dead and nothing can bring him back! 
                         Remarkable.

                         that! How could I have know the gift 
                         was in Fry's locker?

                         Easy! He told you about it before he 
                         died! And your grief roasted mind blocked 
                         it out.

                         certainly thinking it loudly.

                         even if you can't hear me. Blah blah

                         says you're just a dream.

                         in an illusion garden?

                         sweet of you.

                         and brainwaves. Then, when it spilled 
                         on the couch, it recombined with trace 
                         amounts of Fry's hair and skin -

                         various fluids Fry left in the couch 
                         caused the royal jelly to regenerate

                         But the bee stung you. It barely touched 
                         me.
 
               
               [Fry lifts up his shirt. There is a patch where his wound was.]
 
               
               
                                     FRY
                         Stinger went right through me and you 
                         got all the poison. My new spleen came 
                         from a guy who liked to motorcycle.

                         Sweet three toed sloth of ice planet 
                         Hoth! She's awake!
 
               
               [They all cheer.]

                         You were in the best coma I've ever 
                         seen!
 
               
                                     AMY
                         The doctor said you'd never wake up.
 
                         
               
                                     LEELA
                         Really? How long was I out?

                         Two weeks. Fry never left your side 
                         for a minute.

                         And he talked non-stop, like a parrot 
                         of the sea he was.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         I though that if you heard a familiar 
                         voice, it might help keep your mind 
                         together. But, who knows if it really 
                         got through.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         It got through Fry.  It got through.
