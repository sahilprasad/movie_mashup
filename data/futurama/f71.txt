                         To humiliate Elzar in a large stadium.

                         in a coliseum. It is found in a small 
                         kitchen, with friends. That is why I 
                         decline the title of Iron Cook and accept 
                         only the lesser title of Zinc Saucier 
                         which I just made up. Also it comes

                         Professor's bottled ship.  And what 
                         is worse, I framed my dearest friend

                         his ten dollars. So I must take the 
                         only honourable path. what the killing 
                         myself.  Here I go already.  Huh?

                         Lord! According to the spectrolizer, 
                         Spargle's magic ingredient was...water.

                         Ah, so the real gift Spargle gave you 
                         was confidence. The confidence to be 
                         your best.

                         I won fair and square. Now, who wants 
                         brunch? Cooked with plenty of..."confidence"?
