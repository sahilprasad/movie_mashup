               Blah blah blah, something, Bender is great!

               a gap in a fence and see Sal in a hover-digger digging a huge 
               hole at the NNYC Hole Project. Sall dumps a load down on the 
               ground. Amongst some rubble and mud is a bag of fat free potato 
               chips. Fry picks it up.]

                         chips from my time!  There must be layers 
                         and layers of old stuff down there.

                         other people suffering. That's kind 
                         of a pick-me-up.  Wow, that was great.

                         Beck! I'd get up to shake your hand 
                         and steal your wallet but my crappy 
                         body crapped out on me.

                         my body too but then I fished this manequin 
                         out of the 92c Store dumpster.

                         Beck. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet 
                         who transcends genres even as he re-invents

                         never be a musician now.

                         last three hours, but we got into a 
                         serious thing...and then I forgot how

               towards the VW.]
 
               
               [Cut to: VW. He flies through sunroof, slams his head against 
               it and lands in the driver's seat. He shifts it into gear and 
               speeds off in a cloud of smoke. The others hang on.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Golden Gate Park.]

               
                                     HIPPIE #6
                         Oh harsh, I didn't get my beads.

               
               [Zoidberg coughs and beads rain down on the hippies. Beck watches 
               from the stage.]
 
               
                                     BECK
                         You, minion, lift up my arm.  After 
                         him!
 
               
               [His bus pulls up and he gets on with Cylon and Garfunkel, the 
               heads of Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, and Wailing Fungus. The 
               bus ploughs through a crowd and a chase sequence lifted from 
               Bullit begins.]
 
               
               [San Francisco Street. The VW flies down the road, pursued by 
               Beck's bus.]
 
               
               [Cut to: VW. Bender looks in the rear-view mirror.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         Well everyone, prepare to get your guts 
                         kicked out by folk singers.
 
               
               [Cut to: San Francisco Street. The buses drive past a green VW 
               Beetle once, twice, three times, four times...]
 
               
               [Cut to: Chinatown. A Chinese street parade is interrupted as 
               the buses drive past, blowing the Chinese dragon off a caterpillar-like 
               alien.]
 
               
                                     CATERPILLAR ALIEN
                         What is this? The Year of the Jerk?
 
                         
               
               [The VW rounds another corner, carving up another green Beetle.]
 
               
               
               [Cut to: VW.]

                         Hurry, the Golden Gate Bridge. Put the 
                         metal to the pedal to the other metal.
 
                         
               
               [Bender floors it. Beck's bus gets closer and bumps them. They 
               scream. The bus passes a sign that reads "Golden Gate Hoverbridge".]
 
               
               
                                     BENDER
                         Oh no, I forgot this is a hoverbridge.
 
                         
               
                                     LEELA
                         And I forgot this isn't a hovercar.
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         Is any of that a problem?

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Not if you've lived a life without regret.
 
                         
               
               [He screams. The VW flies off the edge of the road and plummets 
               to the ground below.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         I'll save me!

               
               [He leans out of the window and grabs a cable.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         Quick, grab his footcups.

               
               [They all grab Bender's feet.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         Hey? What? No.

               
               [The VW lands softly on a rocky outcrop by the water. Bender 
               has pulled the wire and it is very tense.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Phew!

               
               [They all let go of Bender and the tense wire launches him into 
               the air. The gang watch him fly off. Leela shrugs.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Bummer.

               
               [Fisherman's Worf. The fat guy from the Titanic and a thin woman 
               buy some food from Tarty McTang's and hear Bender screaming from 
               above.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         (shouting) Someone fat get in my way! 
                          (talking) Ah, I'm broken again. I can't 
                         move any part of me.
 
               
                                     BECK
                         Good.

               
                                     BENDER
                         I'm really sorry I lied, Beck. All I 
                         ever wanted was to make music with you. 
                         I never meant to hurt anyone, or help 
                         anyone.
 
               
                                     BECK
                         Bender, that's some played-out, new-jack, 
                         horsecrap. But I know you don't mean 
                         it so, apology accepted.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         So, I can, uh, keep the cheque?

               
                                     GARFUNKEL
                         Over my dead career!

               
               [He takes the cheque out of Bender's chest cabinet.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         Well, it was worth a shot.

               
               [He gets up and the other three leave.]

               
               [Time Lapse. The bus flies away and Bender sighs. The VW floats 
               past. Fry, Leela, Amy and Zoidberg are paddling up the river 
               in it. A seal sits on the roof.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         (shouting) C'mon, Bender. If you're 
                         done scamming Beck, we're heading home.
 
                         
               
                                     BENDER
                         Alright, alright. Let me just do one 
                         thing to cheer myself up.
 
               [He takes a magnet from Ye Olde Tourist Trappe and puts it on 
               his head. His pupils go wild and he starts to sing.]
 
               Fry cracked corn

               And I don't care

               Leela cracked corn

               I still don't care

               Bender cracked corn

               And he is great!

               Take that you stupid corn!

               
               [He wades out into the water to the VW.]
