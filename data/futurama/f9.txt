                         A hush comes over the crowd. The only 
                         sound is Bender calling everyone else 
                         a jerk and he swings!  And he slices 
                         it into the water, oh man!

                         dangerous mission that killed my last

                         This is no ordinary honey. It's produced 
                         by vicious space bees. A single sting

                         pain was so intense that it felt to 
                         him like 15 years. And it goes without 
                         saying that it caused him to empty his 
                         bowels.  We now commend Fry's body to

                         Is this some sort of brain scanner?

                         Some sort yes. In France it's called 
                         a "guillotine."

                         without removing it?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Yes. Easily.

                         Hey, what if Fry wasn't actually dead 
                         when we buried him? Y'know like Julia 
                         Roberts?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Well I suppose there's a slim -  I don't 
                         believe it!

                         What is it? Is Fry alive in some other 
                         dimension or something?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         No. According to this gizmometer, Fry 
                         is dead and nothing can bring him back! 
                         Remarkable.

                         that! How could I have know the gift 
                         was in Fry's locker?
 
               
                                     HERMES
                         Easy! He told you about it before he 
                         died! And your grief roasted mind blocked 
                         it out.

                         No no, no one's saying that! But I'm 
                         certainly thinking it loudly.

                         even if you can't hear me. Blah blah 
                         blah, blah blah blah blah blah.

                         says you're just a dream.

                         in an illusion garden?
 
               
                                     LEELA

                         sweet of you.

                         across the ice fields of Hiperia?

                         cold.

                         how many hundreds of degrees zero it 
                         must be. I just wish I could convince
