               on his bed playing the holophonor. The green holographic smoke 
               snakes upwards from it but he can't form a picture.]

                         Bender?? I was just not playing the 
                         holophonor.

                         at it.

                         when I had those stomach worms that 
                         made me smart? I could play the holophonor 
                         and it made Leela like me.  Hey Bender, 
                         as long as you know, I have a holophonor 
                         recital Tuesday and I'd really like 
                         to have somebody there. Please?

               [Montage Later that night Fry sits in his bedroom playing The 
               Grumpy Snail much better than before. The next day he plays Beethoven's 
               Für Elise to Mrs Mellenger. Like the kid who played it before, 
               the formally dressed man and woman dance. A formally dressed 
               grumpy snail slides between them and the man dances with him 
               instead. A barrel rolls down the steps and knocks the woman over. 
               At Hovercar-Negie Hall Fry plays with a full orchestra to a captivated 
               audience. His holo-dancers dance to the music and twist around 
               the grumpy snail's eyestalks. The audience goes wild. From a 
               balcony Leela watches with tears in her eyes. She applauds.]

                         things I want.  Well, I suppose I've 
                         always wondered what it would be like 
                         to be more annoying.

                         I can really annoy people. And all it 
                         cost me was my crotchplate.

                         night. I'm off to find a pair of formal 
                         gloves that'll fit over my enormous
