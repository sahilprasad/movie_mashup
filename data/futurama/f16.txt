               on his bed playing the holophonor. The green holographic smoke

                         Bender?? I was just not playing the 
                         holophonor.

                         at it.

                         when I had those stomach worms that 
                         made me smart? I could play the holophonor 
                         and it made Leela like me.  Hey Bender, 
                         as long as you know, I have a holophonor 
                         recital Tuesday and I'd really like 
                         to have somebody there. Please?

               [Montage Later that night Fry sits in his bedroom playing The 
               Grumpy Snail much better than before. The next day he plays Beethoven's 
               FÃ¼r Elise to Mrs Mellenger. Like the kid who played it before, 
               the formally dressed man and woman dance. A formally dressed 
               grumpy snail slides between them and the man dances with him 
               instead. A barrel rolls down the steps and knocks the woman over. 
               At Hovercar-Negie Hall Fry plays with a full orchestra to a captivated 
               audience. His holo-dancers dance to the music and twist around 
               the grumpy snail's eyestalks. The audience goes wild. From a 
               balcony Leela watches with tears in her eyes. She applauds.]

                         things I want.  Well, I suppose I've 
                         always wondered what it would be like 
                         to be more annoying.

                         I can really annoy people. And all it 
                         cost me was my crotchplate.

                         night. I'm off to find a pair of formal 
                         gloves that'll fit over my enormous
