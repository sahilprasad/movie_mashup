               they are chased by a dog (which is then eaten by the space monster 
               from The Empire Strikes Back). Back on Earth Sal delivers more 
               papers to them. At Maple Craters they pass Bret Blob's house.

                         Hey Leela, help me apply these flame 
                         decals I got in my cereal. They'll make 
                         the ship go faster.

                         And what's your scientific basis for 
                         thinking that?

                         that ship?

                         Don't worry boys. I'm sure his father 
                         is a perfectly normal reasonable man.

                         Mr Blob, our sons have come to apologise 
                         for damaging your window. They've learned 
                         their lesson and they want to make amends.

                         (ashamed) Sorry sir.

               
                                     DWIGHT
                         (ashamed) Yeah, sorry.

               
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Now see here. We assured our sons that 
                         you'd accept their apology.
 
               
               
               [He laughs. Farnsoworth and Hermes move their sons aside.]

                         No one gives my son that option!

               
               [He and Hermes roll up their sleeves.]

                                     HERMES
                         Aww, you're good kids.  If I could feel 
                         anything right now, it would be pride. 
                          I was wrong! I can still feel pain!

                         ass end of an ass kicking so I figured 
                         you could use a couple of these babys!

                         as long as I 've got this catheter in 
                         me!

                         whats inside that counts.
