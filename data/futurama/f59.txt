                         just cut it out now.

                         Look, Leela. I know there's some perfect, 
                         amazing thing I can do to make you love 
                         me, and when I figure out what it is 
                         -

                         Fry, stop. I don't wanna hurt you, but 
                         there is absolutely, positively no way 
                         that you and I will ever, ever -

                         No! Drugs are for losers and hypnosis 
                         is for losers with big, weird eyebrows.

                         Well, let's divide up the china. I guess 
                         I'll take the NFC helmets and you can

                         lost the woman of your dreams, but you 
                         still have Zoidberg. You all still have

                         No, man. An explosion big enough to 
                         destroy that mama would take out half 
                         the universe.

                         up a little, Farnsy. Make it an implosion.

                         might just form a black hole that would

                                     BENDER
                         I mean, with time, my funk level could 
                         -
 
               
                                     TATE
                         Are you?

               
                                     BENDER
                         (sadly) No.

               
                                     TATE
                         Deal with it.

               
               [He leaves and Bender returns to his normal size and begins to 
               cry.]
 
               
               [The ship flies towards the nebula and Bender emerges from the 
               starboard torpedo tube holding the doomsday device. He is tethered 
               to the ship and wearing a jet pack. The tether jerks and Bender 
               lets go of the doomsday device.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Oh! No!

               
               [He quickly grabs it again.]

               
                                     LEELA
                          Careful with that doomsday device, 
                         Bender.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         What does it matter? I'll never be a 
                         Globetrotter. My life, and, by extension, 
                         everyone else's, is meaningless.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                          Roger.

               
               [Cut to: Ship's Cockpit. She turns the radio off.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Leela, about the wedding. I don't know 
                         what I did to make you love me, and 
                         I don't think I tricked you into it, 
                         but maybe I did. And if I did, I'm sorry.
 
                         
               
                                     LEELA
                         It's OK, Fry. You know we'll always 
                         be friends, right?
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Yeah. But I don't guess anything I could 
                         do will ever make you feel the same 
                         way about me that I do about you.
 
                         
               
                                     LEELA
                         I guess not.

               
               [She takes his hand, kisses him on the cheek and walks away. 
               Bender walks in, dusting his hands.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Well, the doomsday device is ready. 
                         Maybe blasting this quadrant of space 
                         into a hell storm of flaming nothingness 
                         will cheer me up a little.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         OK. Let me just take the ship out to 
                         a safe distance.  Actually, I think 
                         I'll go down and prep the detonator. 
                         Fry, why don't you take the helm?
 
                         
               
               [Fry smiles and sits in the chair. She leaves.]

               
                                     FRY
                         She's so great. I feel like I can almost 
                         remember the magical thing I did to 
                         make her love me. But I guess I never 
                         will.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like 
                         to have a dream I'll never achieve.
 
                         
               
               [He walks out, slowly whistling the Globetrotter tune. Fry presses 
               some buttons and the ship flies away from the nebula. He glances 
               out of the window and sees something.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Oh!  That's how I must have done it! 
                         I moved the stars themselves to write 
                         her a love note in the sky.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                          Detonation in three, two, one.

               
                                     FRY
                         (screaming) Nooo!  Did you see it? Did 
                         you see it?
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         The explosion?

               
                                     FRY
                         No, not the explosion!

               
                                     LEELA
                         Then what?

               
               [Fry thinks for a moment and lowers his head.]

               
                                     FRY
                         (quietly) Nothing.

               
               [Bender starts to whistle Sweet Georgia Brown again as Fry looks 
               back through the window at the black hole.]
