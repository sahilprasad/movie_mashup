                         Exciting news, people! The pet licence 
                         I requsitioned for Nibbler has arrived.

                         Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know 
                         you cared about Nibbler.
 
               
                                     HERMES
                         Dream on, woman. I'd like to put the 
                         little bastard in a sack and toss the 
                         sack in a river and hurl the river into 
                         space. But I do like filling out requisitions 
                         and these were some doozies!  Great 
                         Jah's dreadlocks! There's been a mix-up. 
                         This isn't a pet licence, it's a fishing 
                         licence. And it's mandatory!
 
               
               [The Planet Express ship takes off and heads out to sea. It stops 
               a short while later and the cargo bay lift comes down with Bender, 
               Fry and Farnsworth standing on it.]

                         Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic 
                         Ocean. This seems the logical place 
                         for fish to congregate.
 
               
                                     BENDER

                         Indeed so.

               
               [Bender whips out a radio and talks into it.]

                         has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested.

                         to?

                         wasn't that interesting?

                         This contest is as good as over. I once 
                         caught a fish this big.

                         Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this 
                         big!

                         I'm afraid you're both out of your league, 
                         boys, 'cause you're looking at a woman 
                         who owns her own harpoon.
 
               
               [She twists the top of the harpoon onto the bottom.]

                         OK.

               
               [And she does. He screams in pain and jumps into the water. Hermes 
               looks at five buckets.]

                         Let's see now, which bait to use?  Crickets? 
                         Squid? Chicken necks?
 
               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Excuse me, if I might be so bold, I'm 
                         willing to offer my services as a bait 
                         critic.  These sardines for example 
                         are bland and tasteless.  And these 
                         dry, stringy nightcrawlers, though juicy 
                         ...  ... very very juicy--
 
               
               [He sticks his head in the bucket and gobbles the bait.]

               
                                     HERMES
                         I don't believe this! It's eating my 
                         bait!  Beat it, you mooching crawdad!
 
                         
               
               [Zoidberg runs away and woops. Bender presses a button on his 
               fishing rod.]

                         Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided 
                         fishing rod.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         (whispering) Quiet, Bender, you're scaring 
                         away the fish.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Fine. I'll head over to the other side. 
                          (shouting) Good luck fishing on this 
                         side!
 
               
               [He walks away and Fry casts his line and chuckles.]

                         I can hit a fish between the eyes from 
                         20 yards!
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!

               
                                     FRY
                         A shrimp?  I find it a bit hard to believe 
                         that--
 
               
               [Bender's line hits Fry between the eyes and knocks him over. 
               Leela spins her harpoon around and sees something in the water.]
 
               
               
                                     LEELA
                         Aha!  Gather round, chumps! I got the 
                         winner!
 
               
               [An old boot comes out of the water on the end of the harpoon. 
               Leela sighs.]
 
               
                                     AMY
                         Oh, so this is where you shop for your 
                         boots?
 
               
               [Fry reels in a little fish.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         Couple more of those and you'll have 
                         yourself a fish stick!
 
               
               [He laughs.]

                         Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish 
                         nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's 
                         bigger than anything you've caught. 
                          Ow! My small intestine!
 
               
               [Leela tries again with the harpoon.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times 
                         heavier than a boot.
 
               
               [She pulls out a crate marked "Boots 10 Pair" and sighs.]

                         You'll never catch anything with that 
                         primitive technology. What you need 
                         is this fish pheromone.  The most potent 
                         aphrodisiac known to fishkind.  Uh-oh!
 
                         
               
               [Several fish leap up to his head. He screams and knocks them 
               off. Zoidberg comes up behind him and sniffs him.]
 
               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         (sexfully) I'm so into you!

               
               [He wraps his mouth flaps around Farnsworth's head and slurps.]
 
               
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Oh, my!

               
               [Fry reels in his line. There is big fish attached to it.]

               
                                     FRY
                         (shouting) Hey, Bender, I just caught 
                         a fish this big!
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this! 
                          If I'm not gonna catch a fish, I might 
                         as well not catch a big fish.  There. 
                         Like most of life's problems this one 
                         can be solved with bending.
 
               
               [He ties the ships tether line to the hook.]

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Bender, be careful. That's the ships 
                         diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable.

                         Then why do I have to be careful?

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         It belonged to my grandmother.

               
               [Bender takes some food from Hermes' hands, attaches it to his 
               hook and throws it into the sea.]

                         My manwich!

               
               [Time Lapse. Dusk approaches. Fry is asleep in a chair with his 
               rod next to him, Amy is asleep, Hermes is asleep with sign hanging 
               around him saying he will be awake at 7pm. Bender snoozes, his 
               door opening and closing. Leela casts her harpoon again.]

                         Wake up, everyone! I've got something. 
                         And this time it's alive!  Dr. Zoidberg, 
                         since when do you even wear boots?

                         I wasn't wearing it. (ashamed) I was 
                         eating it.
 
               
               [Leela sighs and lets go of the rope.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         Come on, let's go home.

               
               [Amy wakes up and screams.]

               
                                     AMY
                         Sunburn! My fabulous body! It's ruined! 
                         What happened to my parasol?
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         I don't know. It wasn't here when I 
                         took your umbrella.  What? I put sunblock 
                         on you.

                         I think it was just an airport. They 
                         had a place where you could buy nuts.

                         No! Ancient Atlanta was more than just 
                         a Delta hub. It was a vibrant metropolis, 
                         the equal of Paris or New York.

                         That's right, honey! Whatever you say.

                         a ... fabulous airport, end up underwater?

                         Ah, now that's a story that can only 
                         rightly be told in a Chamber of Commerce 
                         video narrated by folk-rock trubadour

                          Atlanta was a city, landlocked, hundreds 
                         of miles from the area we now call the 
                         Atlantic Ocean,
 
               Yet so desperate the city's desire for tourism that they moved 
               offshore, becoming an island and an even bigger Delta hub,

               Until the city over-developed and it started to sink,

               Knowing their fate, the quality people ran away,

               Ted Turner, Hank Aaron, Jeff Foxworthy, the guy who invented 
               Coca-Cola, the magician and the other so-called gods of our legends,
 
               
               Though gods they were -- and also Jane Fonda was there.

               The others chose to remain behind on their porches with their 
               rifles, and one day evolve into mermaids, and sing and dance 
               and ring in the new.

               Bender.]
 
               
                                     POOPENMEYER
                         And so, in honour of his record-breaking 
                         catch, I'm proud to award Bender this 
                         cheque for $1000.
 
               
               [He shakes Bender's hand and photographers take photos. The crowd 
               cheers. The bass spits out Fry followed by Hermes' manwich.]
 
               
               
                                     LEELA
                         It's you!

               
                                     BENDER
                         Hey, buddy!

               
                                     HERMES
                         My manwich!

               
                                     LEELA
                         Fry, are you alright? What happened?
 
                         
               
                                     AMY
                         What about Umbriel?

               
                                     FRY
                         Well, it turns out I loved her, but 
                         I wasn't in love with her.
 
               
                                     AMY
                         (whispering) Trouble in bed.

               
               [Leela nods.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy.
 
                         
               
               [He puts his arms around Fry. Poopenmeyer looks at the scales.]
 
               
               
                                     POOPENMEYER
                         Wait a-- This is no record! Gimmie back 
                         that cheque! I'm giving it to some giant 
                         orphans.
 
               
               [He snatches the cheque from Bender. Fry starts struggling.]
 
               
               
                                     FRY
                         Ow! Bender, you're hurting me. Ow!
 
                         
               
               [He chokes. The bass' gills open. Zoidberg is inside.]

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Hey! I'm trying to sleep in here!
