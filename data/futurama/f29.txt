                         If you'll excuse me.

               
               [He slides out, leaving a trail of slime behind him. Amy turns 
               around with a box of Slurm glasses and slips on the slime and 
               falls over and screams. The glasses smash.]
 
               
               [Wormulon Cave. Leela, Fry and Bender creep down the dark tunnels. 
               They see torchlight up ahead. Bender gasps.]

               [They duck behind a rock. Two guards slide along the roof of 
               the cave with a torch and laser. They pass them without seeing 
               them and Bender breathes a sigh of relief.]

                         never going 12 minutes without a Slurm 
                         again.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         It's the end of the line. This must 
                         be where they put in the secret ingredient.

                         Well, whatever it is, it's even better 
                         fresh.  Mmm, still warm.
 
               
               [Leela opens the door.]

               
               [Cut to: Slurm Production Chamber. They walk in and gasp. In 
               the middle of the room is a huge worm wearing a crown and scoffing 
               handfuls of Wumpus berries. Some worms massage the middle of 
               her body and the secret ingredient comes out the other end of 
               her and into Slurm cans.]

               the drink.]

               it out of his hand and the Slurm Queen turns around and roars. 
               She hits them with her back end and they duck out of the way. 
               She takes another swipe at Leela and she jumps out the way to 
               Fry and Bender. The Slurm Queen takes another swing and they 
               run out the door screaming. Fry runs back in to pick up the can 
               of Slurm but the Slurm Queen knocks it out of his hands. He groans 
               and runs out again.]

               fire their lasers at them. They come to a ravine and nearly fall 
               into it.]

               appears from behind the Slurm Queen.]

                         Well, my curious friends, you learned 
                         the secret of Slurm. That concludes 
                         the portion of the tour where you stay 
                         alive.

               [She karate chops Glurmo's head off. The decapitated head grows 
               a body and the body grows a head, forming two Glurmos. A guard 
               hands the new head a hat. The Glurmos pin Leela to the floor. 
               Guards point lasers at Fry and Bender's backs. Bender groans.]

                         Good work, Glurmo. You have pleased 
                         your queen.

                         How can you trick people into drinking 
                         something that comes out of your behind? 
                         It's disgusting.
 
               
                                     SLURM QUEEN
                         Is it? Honey comes from a bee's behind. 
                         Milk comes from a cow's behind. And 
                         have you ever used toothpaste?

                         Look, we just came to party with Slurms 
                         MacKenzie. By the way, when is that 
                         scheduled?
 
               
                                     SLURM QUEEN

               [Torture Cave. Bender has been tied to a conveyor belt. It moves 
               towards a machine which converts metal into Slurm cans.]

                         You, my metal friend, will have the 
                         honour of becoming 174 Slurm cans.

                         Ah, this trip is turning into a big 
                         letdown.
 
               
               [Leela is raised in a harness and suspended over a vat of purple 
               goo. The Glurmos stand by a control unit.]

                         As for you, you will be submerged in 
                         Royal Slurm which, in a matter of minutes, 
                         will transform you into a Slurm Queen 
                         like myself.

                         But, your highness, she's a commoner. 
                         Her Slurm will taste foul.
 
               
                                     SLURM QUEEN
                         Yes! Which is why we'll market it as 
                         New Slurm. Then, when everyone hates 
                         it, we'll bring back Slurm Classic, 
                         and make billions!
 
               
               [She and the Glurmos laugh. Small Glurmo #1 pushes a lever down 
               and Leela is lowered into the purple Slurm. Fry watches.]

                         ... if you can resist this concentrated 
                         super Slurm!  It's so delicious, you'll 
                         eat until you explode! Oh, which reminds 
                         me, put a tarp over that sofa, will 
                         you? Bon appétit!
 
               
               [One of the Glurmos forces a spoonful of the Slurm into Fry's 
               mouth. Fry struggles then smiles.]

                         taste.
 
               
               [He takes three.]

                         You pig. Stop stuffing your craw and 
                         save us.
 
               
               [Fry walks towards her then changes his mind and sticks his head 
               into the tub. Bender moves closer to the machine.]

                         I can't see what's happening. Are we 
                         boned?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Yeah, we're boned.

               
               [Fry lifts his head out of the tub and looks around. He sees 
               Bender then Leela then looks back at the Slurm, A tear trickles 
               down his face and splashes into the Slurm.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         I can't stop eating this delicious ooze. 
                         But I'm not gonna let you die.
 
               
               [He moves towards the control unit, dragging the tub with him 
               and shovelling handfuls of Slurm into his mouth.]

                         What's happening?  Just in time!

               
               [He looks down and screams. There is a hole in the middle of 
               his casing. Fry looks through it. While he is distracted, Leela 
               tips the tub of Slurm over and it disappears down a drain.]

                         fit if I didn't have these damn arms!

                         We're close to the exit. I can smell 
                         those filthy orange guys.
 
               
               [Ahead of them is Slurms MacKenzie and the babes.]

               
                                     SLURMS
                         Stop right there!

               
                                     BENDER
                         Slurms MacKenzie?

               
                                     SLURMS
                         Shh! I want you to take me with you.
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         Say what?

               
                                     SLURMS
                         I'm partied out. All I want is to stay 
                         home and rent videos and watch them 
                         with a few friends. Is that so much 
                         to ask?
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Forget it pal.  It says on this bottle-cap 
                         you have to party with us.
 
               
                                     SLURMS
                         Alright, when we get to Earth. But please 
                         don't invite too many people, I wanna 
                         keep it small.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         No can do, Slurms!

               
               [He pats him on the back. The cave starts to shake and the Slurm 
               Queen bursts through the wall. Everyone screams.]
 
               
                                     SLURMS
                         This way!

               
               [He ushers them into another part of the cave. A sign above reads 
               "Danger Cave-In Area". The Slurm Queen follows but gets stuck. 
               She squirts some Slurm around her body as lubricant and squeezes 
               through.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         She's gaining on us.

               
               [Slurms stops running.]

               
                                     SLURMS
                         Go on without me, I'll hold her off.
 
                         
               
               [Everyone else stops.]

                         But she'll crush you like a worm ... 
                         crushing a smaller worm.
 
               
                                     SLURMS
                         It's alright. I'm so tired of partying. 
                         So very tired.  I'll save you the only 
                         way I know how: By partying!  Babes.
 
                         
               
                                     DIXIE
                         Yes, Mr. MacKenzie?

               
                                     SLURMS
                         You've served me well these 40 years, 
                         but this time I've got to party alone.
 
                         
               
                                     BABE
                         But--

               
                                     SLURMS
                         There'll be other parties for you. Now 
                         go. Go!
 
               
               [They run away and Slurms dances and the Slurm Queen closes in. 
               The tunnel starts to collapse and Slurms turns the volume up 
               to maximum. More rocks fall from the roof. Bender turns around.]
 
               
               
                                     BENDER
                         Party on, Slurms!

               
               [He salutes.]

                         Party on, contest winners. Party on.
 
                         
               
               [Bigger rocks falls from above and they pile up in the tunnel. 
               One crushes Slurms and he yelps. The Slurm Queen slams into the 
               pile of rocks.]
 
               
                                     SLURM QUEEN
                         No! We're ruined! They know our disgusting 
                         secret!
 
               
               [She cries. The Glurmos arrive in time to see her drinking her 
               own Slurm.]
 
               
               [The Planet Express ship speeds away from Wormulon.]

               
               [Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Hermes, Zoidberg and Amy sit on the couch, 
               Bender relaxes at his station while Fry and Farnsworth use the 
               phone.]

                         Commissioner, my crew has made a horrific 
                         discovery: It seems that Slurm is produced 
                         in a colossal worm hiney!
 
               
               [On the screen, the commissioner sits in his office in front 
               of a seal with "Bureau Of Soft Drinks, Tobacco, Firearms" written 
               around it.]
 
               
                                     COMMISSIONER
                          Hmm, "hiney", you say? Why, with your 
                         testimony we'll finally be able to outlaw 
                         this insidious Slurm.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Outlaw Slurm?  Uh, don't pay any attention 
                         to him sir ...
 
               
               [Cut to: Commissioner's Office.]

                          ... Grandpa's making up crazy stories 
                         again.
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                          I'm not your grandpa, you're my uncle! 
                         From the year 2000!
 
               
               [Fry makes the cuckoo gesture.]

                          OK, grandpa, we'll take care of the 
                         "bad worms," don't you worry.
 
               
               [He grins and hangs up. Fry opens another can of Slurm.]

                         Ah, I just wish Slurms MacKenzie were 
                         here to enjoy this with me.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Yeah, that Slurms sure loved to party. 
                         Whattya say we all party one last time 
                         for him?

               [Slurms' music plays and the babes run in from the side and start 
               dancing. Bender drinks a can.]

                         Hey, that's not that bad.

               
               [The Slurm trickles out of the hole in his casing. Fry is lying 
               on the floor underneath so the Slurm runs straight into his mouth.]
