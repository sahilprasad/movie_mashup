                         planned but uh, we need some muscle.

                         Robot Mafia. We're here to steal your 
                         cigars.

                         Unless you let us live. Then you'll 
                         get off scot free.

                         Joey, Clamps, hurry and blindfold them 
                         before they see us some more.

                         Hey boss, looks like somebody beat us 
                         to it.

                         enjoying a rather tasty watercress sandwich.
