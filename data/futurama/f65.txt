                         Good news, everyone! You all know the 
                         orphanarium where Leela grew up?

                         Sure. We talk about it all the time.

                         Well done, fellows! Anyway, said orphanarium 
                         has named Leela orphan of the year.

               [Farnsworth pulls a switch on the machine and parts of it start 
               to move around and make noises like the gum machine in Willy

               a tray on the side of the machine.]

                         Ta-da! It's a glow-in-the-dark nose 
                         you can wear over your regular non-glowing 
                         nose. Observe.
 
               
               [He puts the nose on then presses a button on the remote and 
               the lights go off. His new nose glows.]

                         dark.
 
               
               [Farnsworth sneezes and the nose flies off and lands on Bender's 
               face. The lights come back on and everyone stares at Bender.

                         glorking out of the machine?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         That? It's uh...nothing. Yes, nothing. 
                         If you think it's anything you're a 
                         suspicous moron.

                         It looks like toxic waste.  And it smells 
                         like toxic waste.

                         Delicious fig pudding! Ooh, that's good! 
                         But a distinct aftertaste of toxic waste.
 
                         
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Alright, alright so the machine produces 
                         a few toxic by-products! You don't have 
                         to make a federal case out of it.

                         I'm afraid I do.  I order you dispose 
                         of that toxic waste properly, or bribe 
                         me. Either way it'll cost $500.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         500 real dollars? That's an outrage! 
                         Professor, I'll take care of that waste 
                         for $499 and 100 cents.
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Hmm, I know that's a rip but I'll pay 
                         for the convenience. Do you take credit 
                         cards?

                         match!
 
               
               [He chuckles. He starts pushing the hose over the railings towards 
               the street. On its way down the hose shoots some waste across 
               the road where it hits and partially dissolves a tree. The tree 
               falls onto a car which melts the road and disappears through 
               a hole. The hose stops by a manhole and pumps waste into the 
               sewers. Bender whistles and fans his money.]

                         (crying) It's OK, Fry, I'm fine. I won 
                         an award today.

                         Is it this room that's making you sad? 
                         It's probably the room. Come on, lets 
                         go for a walk.
 
               
               [Outside Planet Express. Fry and Leela walk out of the building 
               and walk down the street by the river. Leela has calmed down 
               now.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         I'm sorry you saw that, Fry. I usually 
                         try to keep my sadness pent up inside 
                         where it can fester quietly as a mental 
                         illness.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.

                         I told a whole crowd today that being 
                         an orphan made me strong. But all I 
                         really wanted was a mom and dad, to 
                         hold me and stroke my hair and tell 
                         me they loved me.

                         Then today's your lucky day because 
                         I happen to be a holding, stroking, 
                         lovin' machine! Also spankin'!

                         That's not even close to what I had 
                         in mind.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Well, anyway, just remember that people 
                         care about you.

                         I know.  Sometimes when I'm lonely, 
                         I look up at the sky and I get this 
                         feeling that somewhere, on some unknown 
                         planet, circling a distant star, my 
                         parents are up there, looking down on 
                         me.

                         got hired to clean up the set of Free

                         Bender! Cut it out! First of all the 
                         sewer mutants will be mad. Second, everything 
                         else that's horribly wrong with what 
                         you're doing!

                         Ah, those stupid mutants can't do anything. 
                         You seem to be forgetting one simple 
                         fact, namely, I'm up here and they are 
                         safely down --
 
               
               [Green sewage erupts from a fire hydrant and the manhole. Bender 
               screams. The manhole grows bigger and bigger. Three mutants grab 
               Fry, Leela and Bender and pull them undergroup. They scream. 
               The hole carries on growing and takes Bender's dump truck with
