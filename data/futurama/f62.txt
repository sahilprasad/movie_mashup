               [He takes it and puts it down his trousers.]

               
               [Ice Fortress. Santa sits in a chair at an enormous screen. He 
               laughs maniacally.]
 
               
                                     SANTA
                         Let's see who's been naughty, and who's 
                         been naughty!  Mobsters beating up a 
                         shopkeeper for protection money. Very 
                         naughty!  Shopkeeper's not paying their 
                         protection money. Exactly as naughty! 
                          I saw that!  Huh?
 
               
               [He turns around and sees the Neptunians bring in the wheelbarrow.]

                         Don't you ever knock? Who knows what 
                         naughty things I could be watching? 
                         I get New Orleans on this thing, you 
                         know!

                         Santa's a robot, so we should be able 
                         to destroy him with a logical paradox. 
                         Bender, you'd better cover your ears.
 
                         
               
               [She tears open the bag and they leap out. Santa's eyes turn 
               evil.]

                         Holy night! Intruders!

               
               [He picks up a missile launcher and aims it at Leela.]

                         Hold it Santa!  Consider this: You are 
                         programmed to destroy the naughty. But 
                         many of those you destroy are in fact, 
                         nice. I submit to you, that you are 
                         naughty, and logically, you must destroy 
                         yourself.
 
               
               [Sparks come from Santa's neck. He jitters and his head explodes. 
               Fry and Leela cheer but he immediately grows a new head.]
 
               
                                     SANTA
                         Nice try. But my head was built with 
                         paradox-absorbing crumple-zones.
 
               
               [He raises the missile launcher again. Leela and Fry duck out 
               the way. He aims it at Bender who is still covering his ears. 
               He sees Santa and runs off. They run down a corridor and Santa 
               shoots missiles at them. They duck into an elevator and a missile 
               wedges itself in the door.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Elevator. The crew are huddled in a corner. Leela frantically 
               presses the down button. The elevator goes down and cuts off 
               the top of the missile. It bleeps on the floor. The crew scream.]
 
               
               
               [Cut to: Outside Ice Fortress. Fry and Bender run out followed

               [She tosses the warhead back into the elevator. They get on a 
               sled but it doesn't move.]

               [The bomb explodes and propels the sled down the track. Sentry 
               towers shoot at them and the Santa cut-out sticks out its circular 
               saw.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Jolly Junction. The Neptunians are cooking their bird 
               on a spit. The sled slides past and sprays snow over the fire. 
               They speed on round a corner and hit the steps of the ship. They 
               get off and run inside.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Everyone sits down and Leela presses 
               some buttons. The engines start but the ship just shakes.]

                         I don't know. Usually when I do stuff 
                         like this the ship moves.
 
               
               [Cut to: Outside Ship. Santa is holding the ship by its engines, 
               stopping it from moving.]

               [He looks down. The radiation from the ships engines begins to 
               melt the snow and ice beneath him and he sinks. He lets go of 
               the ship and it lands again. The ice solidifies around him and 
               the Neptunians and crew gather around.]

                                     SANTA
                         Hah! No human could do all that.

                         Santa's right. We need some sort of 
                         robot.  Aw, crap! I'm some sort of robot.
 
                         
               
               [Fry puts his hat on Bender's head. The Neptunians throw their 
               hats in the air.]

                         Bender can't be Santa! He wasn't built 
                         to Yuletide specifications.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Oh, yeah? Well I wasn't built to steal 
                         Leela's purse either.  But that didn't 
                         stop me.
 
               
                                     LEELA

                         (singing) Which is good because we don't 
                         intend to pay.

               We have just a couple hours,

               To make several billion gifts,

                         (singing) Then you'll all work triple 
                         shifts,
 
               You can make the job go quicker if you turn up the controls to

                         My wedding cake!

               
               [Santa and Bender laugh.]

                         Let it snow!

               
               [They fly around a corner and Bender holds handfuls of toys.]
 
               
               
                                     BENDER
                         Merry Xmas, kids!

               
               [He throws the toys through windows and walls. Santa shoots a 
               bike at a little girl. Bender laughs.]

                         This wangs chun! After all the good 
                         we tried to do, Xmas turned out as rotten 
                         as ever.

                         a burning wig.
 
               
               [He hugs LaBarbara. Zoidberg and Fry are also huddled together.]

                         Wait a second! Maybe your futuristic 
                         Xmas isn't so rotten after all.

                         What are you talking about, you crouton? 
                         You said it yourself: Xmas should be 
                         about bringing people together, not 
                         blowing them apart.

                         But don't you see? Fear has brought 
                         us together. That's the magic of Xmas!

                         On, Trasher! On, Smasher!  Hey, Kwanzaabot, 
                         where you off to?

                         Ah, you didn't hear about it? Chanukah 
                         Zombie's having a luau at the B'nai 
                         Brith! You comin'?
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Word!

               
               [The Kwanzaabot flies off. Santa pulls out a present.]

                         By the way, Bender, here's a small token 
                         of my appreciation for being Santa while 
                         I was trapped in the ice.
 
               
               [Bender takes the gift and cheers. He opens it.]

                         Hey, chief, you screwed up. There's 
                         nothing in here.
 
               
                                     SANTA
                         Oh, it might appear empty but the message 
                         is clear: Play Santa again and I'll 
                         kill you next year!  Ho ho ho!
