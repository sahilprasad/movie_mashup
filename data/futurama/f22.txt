                         Oh, I had a nightmare I was in the year 
                         2000 and you guys never existed. I'm 
                         so glad I'm awake now and you're really 
                         here.

                         of anchovies and stuffy old songs about 
                         the buttocks.

                         And why? Because I dared to dream of 
                         my own race of atomic monsters. Atomic 
                         supermen with octagonal-shaped bodies

                         Hello, Fry.

               
                                     LEELA
                         It's Mom.

                         I felt terrible when I heard about your 
                         money troubles and I thought maybe I 
                         could help out a sweet young man by 
                         buying his anchovies.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Sorry. But the anchovies aren't for 
                         sale.
 
               
                                     MOM
                         What? Listen, you little bastard. I 
                         control the robot oil business and I 
                         won't let you ruin me. How much do you 
                         want?
 
               
                                     FRY
                         You might as well put that chequebook 
                         away, because I've discovered something 
                         even more important. My friends. And 
                         they aren't worth even a penny to me. 
                          That's why these anchovies are going 
                         on a pizza, so I can share the food 
                         I love with the people I like.
 
               
                                     MOM
                         Holy hell! You're going to eat them? 
                         Oh, well. Just make sure you eat them 
                         all. You're a growing boy. Toodle-oo!
