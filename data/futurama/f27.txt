                         Mars University.  It's a little experiment 
                         that may well win me the Nobel Prize.

                         Very impressive. Back in the 20th century 
                         we had no idea there was a university 
                         on Mars.

                         Well, in those days Mars was just a 
                         dreary, uninhabitable wasteland, uh, 
                         much like Utah. But unlike Utah, it 
                         was eventually made livable, when the 
                         university was founded in 2636.

                         mathematics of quantum neutrino fields.

                         make me happy.

                         could cry.

                         Look, Guenter, if you're so miserable 
                         here, maybe you should just go back 
                         to the jungle.

                         Thank God this log is sturdy.  (shouting) 
                         Put on the hat, Guenter! You're the 
                         only one who can save us!  (muttering) 
                         Stupid monkey.
 
               
               [Guenter puts the hat on his knee.]

               
                                     FRY
                         No.

               
                                     LEELA
                         Not there.

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Keep trying.

               
               [He puts it on his butt and Fry chuckles. Finally he puts it 
               on his head.]
 
               
                                     GUENTER
                         Eureka! The hat goes on the head. It's 
                         all so obvious now!
 
               
               [The log starts to move.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         (shouting) Help us, Guenter!

               
                                     GUENTER
                         Oh, my goodness. (shouting) Hang on. 
                         I need to do some calculations.  Got 
                         it!  Grab on!
 
               
               [They do and Guenter tumbles over the edge, pulling them upwards. 
               The vine ties itself around them and a branch.],
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         We're saved!

               
                                     FRY
                         'Preciate it Guenter!

               
               [Guenter holds onto the vine as he dangles halfway down the waterfall. 
               The vine starts to break and he whimpers.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Oh, no! Hurry, Guenter, climb up the 
                         vine. You can still save yourself.
 
                         
               
                                     GUENTER
                         Why bother? I've got nothing to live 
                         for. I was miserable as a genius, and 
                         as a monkey, I was so dumb I tried to 
                         wear a hat on my butt.  (sadly) There's 
                         just no place for me in this world. 
                         (normal) Although, on the other hand--
 
                         
               
               [The vine snaps and he screams as he plummets towards the bottom. 
               Farnsworth, Fry and Leela watch him. He hits the water below.]
 
               
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Oh, that poor, sweet monkey. Well lets 
                         go gather him up. There's no sense letting 
                         him go to waste.
 
               
               [He licks his lips.]

               
               [Time Lapse. They reach the foot of the waterfall and find Guenter 
               still alive. His hat is bashed though.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Guenter! You're alive!

               
                                     GUENTER
                         I guess the hat must have broke my fall.
 
                         
               
               [Farnsworth opens up the hat.]

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         It seems to be working at only half-capacity, 
                         but I can fix it.
 
               
                                     GUENTER
                         No, wait! I like it like this. I actually 
                         feel sort of happy.
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         But what about your super-intelligence?
 
                         
               
                                     GUENTER
                         When I had that there was too much pressure 
                         to use it. All I want out of life is 
                         to be a monkey of moderate intelligence 
                         who wears a suit. That's why I've decided 
                         to transfer to business school!
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         (screaming) Nooo!

               
               [Mars University Campus. Dean Vernon keeps his word and reluctantly 
               heads the parade honouring the robots of ERR. Fatbot stands at 
               the front of the float and waves to everyone. Farnsworth and 
               Amy are on the float as well. Guenter leaps on and Farnsworth 
               pats him on the head.]

                         (shouting) Come on, everyone! Big party 
                         in Robot House!
 
               
               [The students cheer and start dancing to Lloyd Williams' Shout. 
               As they dance Animal House-esque subtitles appear under the main 
               characters. "Fry Dropped Out Successfully And Returned To His 
               Dead-End Delivery Job" appears under Fry; "Guenter Got His MBA 
               And Became President Of The Fox Network" appears under Guenter;

               under Fatbot, "Leela Went On One Date With Dean Vernon, But He 
               Never Called Again" under Leela and Vernon and finally "His Job
