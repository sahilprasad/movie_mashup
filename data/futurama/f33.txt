                         Thank you, thank you. Let's get started. 
                         Max, play me over.  Looks like someone 
                         forgot to feed Max.  So, people are 
                         getting pretty worried about this Y2K 
                         problem, huh?

                         long legs in the war of 2012 but I've 
                         still got something you'll never have:

                         up and sing!

                                     AMY (SINGING)
                         He knows when you are sleeping.

               
                                     FARNSWORTH (SINGING)
                         He knows when you're on the can.

               
                                     LEELA (SINGING)
                         He'll hunt you down and blast your ass 
                         from here to Pakistan.
 
               
                                     ZOIDBERG (SINGING)

                                     HERMES (SINGING)
                         You'd better not breathe, You'd better 
                         not move.
 
               
                                     BENDER (SINGING)
                         You're better off dead, I'm telling 
                         you, dude.

               [Everyone cheers. Farnsworth takes off his lab coat, exposing 
               himself again.]
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Merry Xmas, everyone!
