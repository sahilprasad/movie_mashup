                         What If? machine. It can answer any 
                         What If? question, accurate to within

                         I wanna know what would happen if I 
                         were human. I mean, being a robot's 
                         great but we don't have emotions and 
                         sometimes that makes me very sad.

                         if Bender were human?

                         Good news everyone. I've discovered 
                         a way to make Bender human using a process 
                         I call "reverse fossilisation."

                         Well, in regular fossilisation, flesh 
                         and bone turn to minerals. Realising 
                         that, it was a simple matter to reverse 
                         the process. I've already tested it 
                         by turning the toaster into a racoon.
