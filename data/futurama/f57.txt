                         been five, 10 or 15 years? If not, please 
                         disregard this and get back to work.

                         only afford the one ... and the car.

                          It's empty because you haven't paid

                         Listen to me, Fry. Just because you 
                         think you're a robot, doesn't make you 
                         a robot. After all, I think I'm a doctor 
                         but that doesn't make me a doctor. These 
                         fancy clothes do!

                         be a robot. Why else would human women 
                         refuse to date me?
 
               
               [Leela strokes his hair.]

                         (panting) Hey, everybody. Meet my good 
                         pal, Roberto.
 
               
                                     HERMES
                         Hey, mon.

               
                                     ROBERTO
                         Nice to meet you.

               
                                     SMITTY
                         (on megaphone; from outside) Come out 
                         with your hands up.
 
               
                                     ROBERTO
                         (shouting) Hostages!

               
               [Outside Planet Express. Police cars surround the building. Roberto 
               stands at the window with his knife at Zoidberg's neck.]
 
               
                                     ROBERTO
                         Back off! I got hostages!

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Hooray! I'm helping!

               
                                     SMITTY
                         (on megaphone) Do you have any better 
                         hostages?
 
               
               [The megaphone is built into URL.]

               
               [Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. Roberto turns around.]

               
                                     ROBERTO
                         To show them who's crazy, I'm gonna 
                         execute some of you. How 'bout you?
 
                         
               
               [He nicks Farnsworth's neck.]

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Ouch! That's going to bleed when my 
                         heart beats.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Wait! Take me first!

               
                                     BENDER
                         Yes! Take her first.

               
                                     ROBERTO
                         Shut up! Stop telling me how to do this!
 
                         
               
               [Time Lapse. More police cars have arrived outside. Roberto has 
               everyone except Fry tied up in the middle of the room. They mutter 
               in fright.]
 
               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Oh, the fear!

               
               [Roberto kneels next to Bender.]

               
                                     ROBERTO
                         I'm thinking of a number between one 
                         and ten. Guess it and you die first. 
                         Go!
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Um ... OK. Fixty ... six ... ish?

               
                                     ROBERTO
                         56? 56? Oh, man! Now that's all I can 
                         think about! I'm gonna kill you, you 
                         ... no good ... 56-ing--
 
               
               [Bender squeals. Roberto jabs at his with the knife and Bender 
               extends his head on a cable, dodging the knife.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Don't kill me yet! I'm starting to come 
                         down with Stockholm syndrome ... handsome!
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         Halt, fellow robot!

               
               [He stands up from behind the couch.]

               
                                     ROBERTO
                         Hey, Red. You're just in time to join 
                         the hostage situation. Which side you 
                         wanna be on?
 
               
                                     FRY
                         The side that kicks your twisted, metal 
                         ass!
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Fry! Stay back. He's too powerful.
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         Negative, bossy meat creature. I know 
                         now what my primary function is: I am 
                         a battle-droid. Sworn to protect the 
                         weak from crazy robots.
 
               
                                     ROBERTO
                         I'm not crazy! Don't call me crazy! 
                         I'm just not user-friendly!
 
               
                                     HERMES
                         Fry! Don't be a hero! It's not covered 
                         by the health plan!
 
               
                                     ROBERTO
                         Let's see how much of a robot you really 
                         are!
 
               
               [He runs at Fry and stabs him in the chest. Everyone gasps. Fry 
               doesn't react. Roberto pulls the knife out and doesn't see the 
               tin of oil that is still in Fry's pocket. The oil starts to leak 
               through his jacket.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         No knife can penetrate my skin-tanium 
                         armour.
 
               
               [He starts walking towards Roberto, spinning his arms and making 
               a mechanical noise. Roberto backs away.]
 
               
                                     ROBERTO
                         Help! Help! He is a battle-droid! Somebody 
                         help me! Mommy! I'm sorry I spilled 
                         the transmission fluid, Mommy! No! No! 
                         Don't weld me to the wall, Mommy!
 
                         
               
               [He throws the knife at Fry and it slices open his arm. Fry doesn't 
               notice and keeps walking towards him. He screams and jumps through 
               the window.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Outside Planet Express. Roberto falls and lands in the 
               road. His left eye and right arm are broken. He whimpers and 
               collapses.]

                         to your demands.
 
               
               [He starts to put the receiver back into URL's body.]

                         Hey, baby. Wash that off before you 
                         put it back.

                         You did it, Fry.

               
                                     BENDER
                         Congratulations, buddy. You're a credit 
                         to my race.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         (mechanical voice) It was nothing. I-- 
                          (normal) Blood? Robots don't have blood. 
                         I must be a, a--

                         A squid?

               
                                     FRY
                         A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human!

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Also good.

               
               [Time Lapse. The police cars clear away. Zoidberg cuts a bandage 
               that he has wrapped around Fry's wound.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Thanks for saving us, Fry.

               
               [She kisses him on the cheek.]

               
                                     FRY
                         I'm gonna continue never washing this 
                         cheek again.

                         Buddy, you may be wrapped in greasy 
                         skin, but inside, you've got the heart 
                         of a robot.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Aw. Thanks, Bender.

               
                                     BENDER
                         Just like inside me, I've got the heart 
                         of a human.  What?
