                         of things to a lot of people, but looking 
                         back, the number one thing I can say 
                         about him is this, and simply this: 
                         Bender was my friend.

                         Hear the word of Pharaoh. Build unto 
                         me a statue of ridiculous proportion. 
                         One billion cubits in height......that 
                         I might be remembered for all eternity. 
                         And be quick about it!

               ground shakes as the leg is moved into position. He whips two 
               architects as they look at the design for the statue's ass. Fry 
               takes a "1" to a " - Days Since Last Accident" sign. But instead 
               of hammering the 1 on he hammers his hand to the sign. The 1 
               falls to the ground and Fry bends down to pick it up but can't 
               reach it.]
 
               
               [The statue is almost finished. The statue's foot is positioned 
               so it looks like it is about to crush Hermenthotip's tomb. Up 
               in space the slaves, in spacesuits, lift Bender's antenna ball 
               to the top of the statue. Bender floats near them wearing a jet

               looks up at the statue. Skeletons are sticking out of the foot.

                         by setting fire to the distillery and 
                         blowing this whole place to rubble!

                         No. But I bet it wasn't someone who

                         Bender, I understand your desire to 
                         be remembered. But you don't need a 
                         statue for that.
 
               
                                     BENDER

                         No. You have your legacy as a brutal 
                         tyrannical dictator. And that will outlive 
                         any monument.

                         Well in that case. One planet down! 
                         Helmsman...
 
               
               [Cut to: Outside Ship.]

               
                                     BENDER [FROM SHIP]
                         ...set course for Earth!

               
               [The ship flies towards a planet and he laughs insanely.]

               
                                     LEELA [FROM SHIP]
                         That's not Earth.

               
                                     BENDER [FROM SHIP]
                         Oh.

               
               [The ship zooms away from the planet.]
