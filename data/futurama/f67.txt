                         of things to a lot of people, but looking 
                         back, the number one thing I can say 
                         about him is this, and simply this: 
                         Bender was my friend.

                         Hear the word of Pharaoh. Build unto 
                         me a statue of ridiculous proportion. 
                         One billion cubits in height......that 
                         I might be remembered for all eternity. 
                         And be quick about it!

               architects as they look at the design for the statue's ass. Fry 
               takes a "1" to a " - Days Since Last Accident" sign. But instead 
               of hammering the 1 on he hammers his hand to the sign. The 1 
               falls to the ground and Fry bends down to pick it up but can't

               to the top of the statue. Bender floats near them wearing a jet

                         by setting fire to the distillery and 
                         blowing this whole place to rubble!

                         be remembered. But you don't need a 
                         statue for that.
 
               
                                     BENDER

                         No. You have your legacy as a brutal 
                         tyrannical dictator. And that will outlive 
                         any monument.
