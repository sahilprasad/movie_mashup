                         Wall Street. I was having whiskey with 
                         Boesky and cookies with Milken. But

                         takeover and sold off all the assets. 
                         Made a cool hundred mil.  Naturally 
                         I froze myself until a cure was found.

                         I'll be whatever I wanna do! That Guy 
                         was the greatest businessman that ever 
                         lived and before his mysterious death 
                         he taught me everything he knew.  But 
                         some things I had to learn myself.  
                         I learned that money is fine but in 
                         the end what counts is people... ...People 
                         you love... ...You can't put a price 
                         on that... So I'm giving up control 
                         of the company... ...to a man of enourmous 
                         experience... ...Professor... ...Hubert 
                         Farnsworth.
 
               
               [Farnsworth is still asleep but is now wearing a sleeping cap 
               and bunny slippers. He wakes up.]
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Oh uh what? I'm awake, I'm awake!

               
               [The stock price goes haywire. Tape falls from the ceiling an 
               the Planet Express crew slide down on it.]

                         Let Mom buy the company! We all wanna 
                         be filthy stinking rich!

                         You mean you'd rather be rich than work 
                         together?
 
               
                                     LEELA

                         In my whole life this company was the 
                         only place I ever really felt at home. 
                         If being millionaires is more important 
                         to you than our...

                         ...friendship, then I'll sell Planet

                         Millionaires nothing! The stock's only 
                         worth three kajiggers!

                         My Jah! It's worth less now than when 
                         it was worthless!
 
               
                                     FRY
                         It is? Yahoo! We're poor no matter what 
                         I do! The deal is off!

               No.]

                         Aha! Once again the conservative sangwich-heavy 
                         portfolio pays off for the hungry investor! 
                          Oh! I'm ruined.  Why? Why?
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Look, so we're not millionaires. At 
                         least we all still get to work together!
