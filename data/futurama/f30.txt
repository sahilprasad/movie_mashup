                         Nightfall? How can you tell down here?
 
                         
               
               [Splashing noises echo around the village.]

                         The tide is coming in.

                         Quiet, the beast approaches.

               
               [Loud bangs come from the pipe as El Chupanibre gets closer. 
               The mutants, Fry and Bender scarper. Fry dives behind some boxes 
               and Bender and Dwayne join him. Raoul runs into a building and 
               draws the curtains across him. El Chupanibre's shadow appears 
               and Leela gasps. The huge shadow gets smaller and it turns out 
               to be Nibbler.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Nibbler! Aw, come here precious!  Look 
                         everyone, it's El Chupanibre.
 
               
                                     DWAYNE
                         That's not El Chupanibre.

               
                                     BENDER
                         Say what?

               
                                     DWAYNE
                         That's El Chupanibre.

               
               [He points to a huge green monster standing in the pipe looking 
               down on Bender. It has fangs and yellow bloodshot eyes. Bender 
               looks round, screams, drops Nibbler and runs away.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         I'll take care of this.

               
               [He steps into the rope trap and screams as it lifts him off 
               the ground and leaves him dangling overhead. El Chupanibre gets 
               closer to Nibbler. Leela screams, making Bender scream.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Bender, do something.

               
                                     BENDER
                         I'm too scared.

               
                                     FRY
                         Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted 
                         straight to Bender. If you care about 
                         Nibbler, stop caring about him!
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         I can't. I love every living creature.

                         Even me?

               
                                     LEELA
                         As a friend.

               
                                     FRY
                         Damn.

               
               [Leela starts to cry.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         Listen to me, Leela: I'm an expert at 
                         not caring. The secret is to stop giving 
                         a rat's ass about anyone else and start 
                         thinking of the things that you want, 
                         that you deserve, that the world owes 
                         you.

                         Well, I could use a new tank top.

               
                                     BENDER
                         Bigger! Bigger!

               
                                     LEELA
                         A fashionable tank top. And designer 
                         boots ... encrusted with jewels.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Don't stop now, you'll need some pants 
                         to go with that outfit.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Yeah. And I could afford it all if I 
                         didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler.
 
                         
               
               [Bender's chip beeps.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler.
 
                         
               
               [He kicks Nibbler out the way and starts rotating his arms. El 
               Chupanibre grabs them and pulls them off. Bender groans. El Chupanibre 
               grabs him and lifts him towards his mouth.]

                         Bender's gonna be killed!

                         You know what else I could use? A weekend 
                         at one of those fancy spas. And a Toblerone.
 
                         
               
               [El Chupanibre prepares to eat Bender. Bender's detached arms 
               tap him on the shoulder and he looks around. They punch him and 
               he drops Bender. Bender charges at him and knocks him flying 
               into the huge toilet. His arms flush the monster away and everyone 
               cheers.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         (cheering) Yeah!

               
                                     LEELA
                         You did it!

                         Let's have a tissue-tape parade!

               
                                     BENDER
                         No thanks.

               
               [Dwayne unties Leela and another mutant cuts Fry down. He falls 
               into the water and splutters. Nibbler runs towards Leela and 
               jumps into her arms and licks her. Dwayne sits on the toilet 
               with his guitar.]
 
               
                                     DWAYNE
                         Gather round, children, to hear the 
                         legend of Bender.
 
               [He strums the guitar.]

               (singing) He came from above with a--

               [A string snaps and he sighs.]

               (talking) It's gonna be many a year before someone flushes another 
               guitar string.
 
               
               [Planet Express: Meeting Room. Fry, Leela and Bender are back 
               and everyone is with them. Bender holds a cigar.]

                         That was a disgusting story.

               
                                     LEELA
                         And it's all thanks to Bender. I love 
                         you, Bender.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         I love you too.  Get that stupid chip 
                         out of me before I kill myself!
 
               
               [Farnsworth prises the chip off with a screwdriver and looks 
               at it.]

                         Bender, you won't believe this, but 
                         the empathy chip burned out. The emotion 
                         you felt for Nibbler was actually your 
                         own.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Looks like Bender learned an important 
                         lesson about respecting other people's 
                         feelings afterall.
 
               
               [Everyone else nods and murmurs in agreement.]

                         No, I'm wrong. The empathy chip was 
                         running at triple capacity.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, 
                         losers!
 
               
               [He walks out.]

                         You know, Bender may not have learned 
                         anything from me, but I think I actually 
                         learned something from him.  (shouting) 
                         So long, jerkwads!
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                          So long!
