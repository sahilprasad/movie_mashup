                         This is getting confusing. Why don't 
                         we call our universe "Universe A" and 
                         this universe "Universe B"?

                         Wait a minute. If our universes are 
                         identical then why did our Leela look 
                         into the box and your Leela didn't?

                         came up tails so I didn't look.

                         have opposite outcomes.

                         Funny story. I asked Leela out a million 
                         times and she just kept rejecting me.

                         boot-rash" or "I have to meet the President"!

                         But, like a dope, I believed her. Looking 
                         back on it now it's kinda funny!

                         the only excuse I could think of involved 
                         ghosts. I knew he wouldn't buy it so

                         I flipped a coin. It came up heads and 
                         we went out.

                         it was tails? So that's why you said 
                         you had to meet that ghost.

                         That date was magical.

                         Yes, all that is and ever shall be is 
                         in that box! And the box itself is probably 
                         worth something too. We must cherish 
                         it, as we cherish every moment of our 
                         lives.
