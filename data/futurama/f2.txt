                         Ahem! For my next trick, notice I have 
                         nothing up my sleeves......and nothing 
                         in my head.  So if my lovely assistant 
                         will kindly supply me with an ordinary, 
                         non-fake pitcher of milk......behold 
                         the milk has vanished! Exiled, perhaps, 
                         to another dimension!

                         Indeed. You see, that fossil was made 
                         of dolomite. The tough black mineral 
                         that won't cop out when there's heat 
                         all about. By contrast, observe the 
                         lava's affect on this ice swan.  Of 
                         course, that would have melted even 
                         at room temperature. I just wanted to 
                         get rid of it. But had it been made 
                         of that righteous mineral dolomite, 
                         there's a slim chance it might have 
                         survived.

                         Please stop crying Fry. Here.  I assumed 
                         you were just pretending to love the 
                         dog. To toy with my emotions. Oh what 
                         have I done?

                         Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood 
                         how someone can love an inferior creature. 
                         Because I love you. Not in the way of 
                         the Ancient Greeks, but in the way a 
                         robot loves a human, a human loves a 
                         dog and occassionally, a gorilla loves 
                         a kitty.  I'm goin' in!

                         melt. The fossil only has a chance because

                         Seymour died at the ripe old age of 
                         15.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         15? You mean he lived for 12 more years 
                         after I got frozen?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Indeed.

               
                                     FRY
                         Stop the cloning.

                         Think about it. Seymour lived a full 
                         life after I was gone. He probably added 
                         new songs to his repertoire.

                         But that's a good thing. Walking On 
                         Sunshine sucks noodles!
 
               
                                     FRY
                         I had Seymour 'til he was three. That's 
                         when I knew him and that's when I loved 
                         him.  I'll never forget him. But he 
                         forgot me a long long time ago.

               the film Les Parapluies de Cherbourg plays. Seymour sits outside 
               Panucci's Pizza waiting for Fry to come back. It changes to summer, 
               then autumn, a snowy and rainy winter and back to spring. Panucci 
               gives Seymour a slice of pizza. It goes through autumn and winter 
               again. Seymour starts to age a little. The "U" from the "Panucci's 
               Pizza" sign falls on a man. An aged Panucci pats Seymour on the 
               head. Seymour continues waiting for Fry to return, and closes 
               his eyes...]
