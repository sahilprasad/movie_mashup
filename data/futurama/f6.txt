                         Leela, I think you're missing the big 
                         picture. When you were a kid what was 
                         your biggest fantasy?

                         Whatever. The correct answer is: To 
                         be a superhero. We have superpowers 
                         and we're Americans. This is our chance.

                         serve the community that incorporates 
                         my violence. Let's do it!

                         you today and you had superpowers.

                         Wow, crime-fighting. Cool. You say you're 
                         a duo? Yeah duos are good. Of course 
                         sometimes they're a little short handed. 
                          See ya. With two humans you'd think 
                         there'd be a robot in there...to balance 
                         things out. But, whatever.  I have these 
                         three costumes you could use. But, I 
                         guess I'll just throw one away.

                         We'd love to have you on the team Bender. 
                         But aren't you more on the supply side 
                         of crime?

                         Hawk! Fetch!

                         That seemed unnecessary.

                         Our transaction is complete. Come Solomon, 
                         to the lair.

                         Mom, Dad, oh I'm so sorry I got you 
                         kidnapped by a crazy madman who tried 
                         to feed you to pirhanas.
 
               
                                     MUNDA
                         We're just happy to be involved in your 
                         life.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         No no, it's my fault for telling you 
                         I was a superhero.
 
               
                                     MORRIS
                         That's true.

               
                                     LEELA
                         I just couldn't stand to have you to 
                         think I was ashamed of you.
 
               
                                     MUNDA
                         That's OK sweetie, but, it's natural 
                         for children to be a little ashamed 
                         of their parents.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Oh yeah!

               
                                     MORRIS
                         Just like it's natural for parents to 
                         be a little disappointed in their children...n-not 
                         that we are.
 
               
                                     MUNDA
                         But you could call a little more often.
 
                         
               
                                     LEELA
                         OK.

               
                                     MUNDA
                         And would it kill you to use some mouthwash?

                         Hey Fry we've still got our costumes

                         I guess, as long as you think it's right.
